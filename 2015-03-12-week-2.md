# Week 2: Web Design Process, Tools, and Principles

## What we'll be building in this course:
Before we really dig into writing code, let's talk about the process of designing a website: from idea to fully realized site. As a group we'll go through each step of the process, and the designs that we create will serve as a foundation for your individual projects.

There are a few different directions we can go with these projects, but here are a few suggestions to get your creative juices flowing:

### Useful Templates
Choose something that you think would be a useful tool, that maybe other people would use/find interesting if it had real, dynamic data included.
- A blog: design a personal or professional blog. Questions to consider may be: how to handle a featured post, list view vs grid view, data included in each post (author, date, title, topics), styling of an individual post once it's expanded, how to display archived posts, etc. 
- A weather site: design a site to display the weather. Questions to consider may be: what data to emphasize, how to display changes over time, how to handle location, etc.
- A music library:

### Art
Choose a theme or topic as a group, then individually explore different layouts and approaches. Start with simple shapes (a la 8-bit block art), and as the course progresses add in more sophistication (curves, svg shapes, animations, etc). At the end of the course we can create a site for the class where each that links to each individual art board.
- The Chicago skyline: create a realistic or abstract view of the city skyline. Put emphasis on different buildings, natural things, signs, etc.
- Outer space: create the solar system, a scene on a particular planet, earth, etc.
- Recreate famous art: build the Mona Lisa, The Great Wave, American Gothic, etc in HTML & CSS.
- A house: get as detailed as you like and create your dream house or your childhood home.
- A nature scene: create a forest with animals, an ocean scene, a mountain range.

### Redesign a Live Website
There are lots of sites that would benefit quite a bit from a redesign: choose one or a few as a group and put your own spin on it. Discuss what they do well, what content is important to keep and what can be removed, how other sites in that space handle things differently.
- The New York Times
- Facebook/Twitter

## Web Design Process
There is a wide range of ways to design and build a website, and every person/team will do things a little differently. The model we'll use here was designed for client work: starting from scratch with just an idea, doing some research on how other sites handle similar problems, narrowing down a feature list to the essential components, wireframing the layout of the site, and choosing an aesthetic direction in which to take it.

### Feature List
List out all of the features you might want to include on the site, then try to narrow it down to only the ones you absolutely need. There's always time to add things in later, but it's good to start out with the most crucial pieces.

### External Research
Spend some time exploring other sites that operate in the same space. Make note of treatments you like (maybe they have a really interesting navigation setup, or a neat hover effect you hadn't seen before) that you can try to incorporate into your site. Take screenshots, write down ideas, etc.

### Wireframe
Before getting into the more superficial aspects of your site (typography, color, etc), focus on the layout and structure of the page. This will help you start thinking about your HTML as modular elements, and inform your decisions on how to group portions of your code.

### Choose an Aesthetic Direction
[StyleTiles](http://styletil.es/) are a great template for this part of the design process. Choose a color palette, a font or font pair, button styles, the general vibe/feeling you'd like to inspire on your site, textures you may want to use.

From here there are really two options: create high fidelity mockups in a program like Illustrator or Photoshop, or go straight to markup. Since this is a development-focused class, we will be jumping straight to markup.
