# Final Presentations & Next Steps

Congratulations â€” you've made it! This last class will likely be on the shorter side, focusing on presentations and what some potential next steps are in continuing to learn web design and development.

## Class Workflow Overview

1. The first 30 minutes or so should be spent one-on-one with students helping resolve any last minute issues before presentations. Instructors: make note of any recurring themes, and if there is a topic that multiple students are still struggling with, spend some time after presentations on a quick review lesson and try to provide resources for students to reference later.
2. Presentations! Short, informal presentations from each student. Group should give feedback and help work through remaining problems.
3. Talk about next steps, what else is out there in the great big wolrd of web development.
4. If students are interested, help them push their sites up to a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) repo and get them live! If any students have purchased domain names, help them in configuring them to point to github pages.
5. Answer any remaining questions.

## Presentations

Each student should present their site to the class, describing what they've made and how they intend to build upon it. Presentations are informal and shouldn't take more than a few minutes each. Share the reasons behind choices you made in design or development of the site, and areas where you maybe are still stuck or would like to improve. What features would you like to add in the future?

As a group, offer constructive feedback on the projects, and suggest possible solutions to any unsolved problems.

## What's next?

As this is just an introductory course in design and front-end web development, there is much more to learn!

### HTML and CSS topics not covered in class

**SVG**

Scalable vector graphic (svg) is both a file format and an HTML element used for displaying graphics. SVGs are incredibly light-weight files, and can be scaled infinitely without ever becoming pixelated.

**Keyframe Animations**

Keyframes were alluded to last week as they fit under the same umbrella as transitions and transforms. They are powerful tools for creating stepwise animations in CSS.

**Video & Audio**

HTML5 provides the ability to embed video and audio files directly on your webpage.

**Canvas**

The canvas element allows 2D graphics to be drawn on the page using JavaScript.

### SASS

Once you've mastered the basics of CSS, the next logical step is to dive into a CSS extension language like [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) or [LESS](http://lesscss.org/). These allow you to create mixins and variables, which serve to significantly simplify your code. 

### JavaScript

### Git and Github

### Blogs & Content Management Systems

### Web Applications

## Looking Forward
