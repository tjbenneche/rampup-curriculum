# Final Presentations & Next Steps

## Presentations

Each student should present their site to the class, describing what they've made and how they intend to build upon it. Presentations are informal and shouldn't take more than a few minutes each. Share the reasons behind choices you made in design or development of the site, and areas where you maybe are still stuck or would like to improve. What features would you like to add in the future?

As a group, offer constructive feedback on the projects, and suggest possible solutions to any unsolved problems.

## What's next?
