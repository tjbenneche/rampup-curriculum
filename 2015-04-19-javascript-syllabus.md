# An Introduction to JavaScript

This is an eight-week course on the fundamentals of computer programming in JavaScript, and its practical uses on the web. The former will comprise the first half of the course — taking you through functions, data structures, and algorithms. The second half will focus on applying JavaScript in modern web development.

## Week 1 - The Basics of Computer Programming

This class will provide a context for JavaScript, explain some programming best practices, and introduce some basic syntax and data types.

- **Programming Languages**: different types of languages, where JavaScript fits in
- **History**: a brief discussion of JavaScript's past, and how far it's come
- **Documentation**: the benefits of well documented code
- **Testing & Debugging**: different methods for testing, debugging
- **Syntax**: a quick look at the basic syntax of JavaScript
- **Variables**: practice declaring variables 
- **Data Types**: an overview of the various data types in JavaScript

## Week 2 - Functions

This class will explain how to work with various types of functions, how to pass in arguments, and how to deal with objects that are returned. 

- **Objects**: discuss functions as objects and their prototypal nature
- **Arguments**: how to pass in objects to be used by a function
- **Recursion**: functions that invoke themselves to solve subproblems
- **Callbacks**: the building blocks of JavaScript's asynchronicity

## Week 3 - Statements & Loops

This class will focus on conditional and looping statements, showing how to iterate through objects and evaluate if certain conditions have been met.

- **Conditionals**: using if and switch statements to set conditional routines
- **Loops**: using for, while, and do statements to iterate over variables

## Week 4 - Data Structures and Algorithms

- Various data structures
- Search and Sort
- Various algorithms

## Week 5 - JavaScript on The Web

- DOM manipulation
- Using selectors
- Build some basic jQuery functions

## Week 6 - jQuery and Other Libraries


## Week 7 - AJAX & JSON

## Week 8 - Hackathon & Presentations
