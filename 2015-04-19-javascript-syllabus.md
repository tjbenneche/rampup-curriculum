# An Introduction to JavaScript

This is an eight-week course on the fundamentals of computer programming in JavaScript, and its practical uses on the web. The former will comprise the first half of the course — taking you through functions, data structures, and algorithms. The second half will focus on applying JavaScript in modern web development. Students should walk away with a solid understanding of programming techniques, classic computer science paradigms, JavaScript fundamentals and its application on the web.

## Week 1 - The Basics of Computer Programming

This class will provide a context for JavaScript, explain some programming best practices, and introduce some basic syntax and data types.

- **Programming Languages**: different types of languages, where JavaScript fits in
- **History**: a brief discussion of JavaScript's past, and how far it's come
- **Documentation**: the benefits of well documented code
- **Testing & Debugging**: different methods for testing, debugging
- **Syntax**: a quick look at the basic syntax of JavaScript
- **Variables**: practice declaring variables 
- **Data Types**: an overview of the various data types in JavaScript

## Week 2 - Functions

This class will explain how to work with various types of functions, how to pass in arguments, and how to deal with objects that are returned. 

- **Objects**: discuss functions as objects and their prototypal nature
- **Arguments**: how to pass in objects to be used by a function
- **Recursion**: functions that invoke themselves to solve subproblems
- **Callbacks**: the building blocks of JavaScript's asynchronicity

## Week 3 - Statements & Loops

This class will focus on conditional and looping statements, showing how to iterate through objects and evaluate if certain conditions have been met.

- **Conditionals**: using if and switch statements to set conditional routines
- **Loops**: using for, while, and do statements to iterate over variables

## Week 4 - Inheritance, Data Structures, and Algorithms

This class will examine some classic computer science problems, approaches for solving them, and how inheritance works in JavaScript.

- **Inheritance**: object orientation in JavaScript, pseudoclassicalism, prototypal inheritance
- **Data Structures**: classic computer science paradigms in JavaScript 
- **Algorithms**: various search and sort techniques, runtime performance

## Week 5 - JavaScript on The Web

This class will depart from JavaScript fundamentals to demonstrate its use on the web, how to manipulate HTML/CSS, and the building blocks of popular frameworks.

- **DOM Manipulation**: how to use selectors and manipulate elements on a web page via user action 
- **Basic Web Functions**: build simple functions that would be found in a framework like jQuery to handle interaction on the web

## Week 6 - jQuery and Other Libraries

This class will introduce popular JavaScript web frameworks, particularly jQuery, and their implementation.

- **Frameworks**: how to include a framework or library in your project, various usecases
- **jQuery**: implement jQuery, examine source code to compare to functions written in class, review syntax differences from vanilla JavaScript

## Week 7 - Interacting with Data, AJAX & JSON

This class will explain how to work with external data objects, the JSON format, and asynchronous interaction via AJAX.

- **JSON**: overview of syntax, uses, and methods for interacting with data in this format
- **AJAX**: how to make HTTP requests via JavaScript, asynchronously load content and pass data without refreshing the page

## Week 8 - Hackathon & Presentations

In this class, students will break into small teams to tackle a challenge given by the instructor. Following the hackathon, groups will present their results and discuss the various approaches taken.
