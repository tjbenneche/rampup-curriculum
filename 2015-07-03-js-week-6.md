# A Deeper Dive into jQuery

Last week we learned how to select individual elements, change some of their basic style attributes, and add event listeners to them.

Where you really begin to see the power of jQuery is in elements' relational data â€” traversing up and down the DOM to find parents, children, siblings, etc.

## Class Workflow

1. Review last week's homework
2. Optimizing specifity - how best to select elements
3. $(this) - how it differs from JavaScript's native "this", when to use it
5. Chaining functions
6. DOM traversal - parents, children, siblings, adding and removing data
7. Discuss homework!

## Optimizing Specificity

While it is convienent to select elements using only jQuery's object notation $(''), it is not always the most efficient.

The magic that makes jQuery's selector notation work is a JavaScript engine called [Sizzle](http://sizzlejs.com/). 

Take, for instance, the following lookup:

	$('#myDiv p.inner-text')
    
Because this is an _ancestor descendant_ selector, jQuery's Sizzle engine will read it right-to-left. It will search the entire DOM for### elementsOptimizing matchingSpecificity "p.inner-text" and then return ones that are descendants of #myDiv. It's easy to see how this could slow down performance as the size and complexity of your web page increases.

A better way to write this would be to separate out the ID selector and search for the element within it:

	$('#myDiv').find('p.inner-text')

The jQuery .find() method uses its Sizzle enigne as well, but an ID selector is extremely fast because it is just an alias for the browser's native document.getElementById function.

A closing thought:

Only be as specific as it makes sense to be: chaining 3 or more selectors together actually increases the amount of work the browser has to do. If it's an ID, just use that, and otherwise stick to two.

## Traversing the DOM

### this and $(this)

this is raw JS, $(this) is jQuery

$() is the jQuery constructor function.

this is a reference to the DOM element of invocation.

so basically, in $(this), you are just passing the this in $() as a parameter so that you could call jQuery methods and functions.

### Parents, Children, and Siblings

Because of HTML's hierarchical structure, the parent/child or sibling relationship between elements might not be obvious. If it helps, imagine it like a vertical tree, with the "root" html tag at the very top. Every tag nested inside that is a child element, and so forth.

**parent()**
To select an element's parent:

	<div class="parent">
    	<p class="child">Child</span>
    </div>
    
    // returns div.parent
    $( "p.child" ).parent();
 
**parents()**

The parents() function returns all of the target elements ancestors, all the way up to the root html tag.

	// returns div.parent, body, html (assuming no other elements on page)
	$('p.child').parents()
 
In the parents function, we can pass a selector as a paremeter to select _only_ ancestors that match the given criteria:
 
    // returns div.parent
    $( "p.child" ).parents( "div.parent" );
    
**closest()**

The closest() function selects the closest parent matching the given selector, INCLUDING the target element.
 
    // returns div.parent
    $( "p.child" ).closest( "div" );
 
	// returns p.child
    $('p.child').closest('.child');

children:

// Selecting an element's direct children:
 
// returns [ div.parent, div.surrogateParent1, div.surrogateParent2 ]
$( "div.grandparent" ).children( "div" );
 
// Finding all elements within a selection that match the selector:
 
// returns [ div.child, div.parent, div.surrogateParent1, div.surrogateParent2 ]
$( "div.grandparent" ).find( "div" );

siblings:

next, prev, siblings

.closest()
