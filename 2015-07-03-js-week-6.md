# A Deeper Dive into jQuery

Last week we learned how to select individual elements, change some of their basic style attributes, and add event listeners to them.

Where you really begin to see the power of jQuery is in elements' relational data â€” traversing up and down the DOM to find parents, children, siblings, etc.

## Class Workflow

1. Review last week's homework
2. Optimizing specifity - how best to select elements
3. $(this) - how it differs from JavaScript's native "this", when to use it
5. Chaining functions
6. DOM traversal - parents, children, siblings, adding and removing data
7. Discuss homework!

## Traversing the DOM

### Optimizing Specificity

.find()

### this and $(this)

this is raw JS, $(this) is jQuery

$() is the jQuery constructor function.

this is a reference to the DOM element of invocation.

so basically, in $(this), you are just passing the this in $() as a parameter so that you could call jQuery methods and functions.

### Parents, Children, and Siblings

traversing

// Selecting an element's direct parent:
 
// returns [ div.child ]
$( "span.subchild" ).parent();
 
// Selecting all the parents of an element that match a given selector:
 
// returns [ div.parent ]
$( "span.subchild" ).parents( "div.parent" );
 
// returns [ div.child, div.parent, div.grandparent ]
$( "span.subchild" ).parents();
 
// Selecting all the parents of an element up to, but *not including* the selector:
 
// returns [ div.child, div.parent ]
$( "span.subchild" ).parentsUntil( "div.grandparent" );
 
// Selecting the closest parent, note that only one parent will be selected
// and that the initial element itself is included in the search:
 
// returns [ div.child ]
$( "span.subchild" ).closest( "div" );
 
// returns [ div.child ] as the selector is also included in the search:
$( "div.child" ).closest( "div" );

children:

// Selecting an element's direct children:
 
// returns [ div.parent, div.surrogateParent1, div.surrogateParent2 ]
$( "div.grandparent" ).children( "div" );
 
// Finding all elements within a selection that match the selector:
 
// returns [ div.child, div.parent, div.surrogateParent1, div.surrogateParent2 ]
$( "div.grandparent" ).find( "div" );

siblings:

next, prev, siblings

.closest()


## Chaining

don't query the DOM as much
