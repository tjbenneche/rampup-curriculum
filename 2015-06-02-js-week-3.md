# Functions

## Class Workflow

The flow for each individual topic should be as follows:
- Discuss high level overview: why it matters, how it fits in to overall goals, why we're learning it in this order
- Explain logic via pseudo-code, either on whiteboard or projector.
- Live code example as a group
- Individual exercises
- Group exercise (pick one of the more challenging individual exercises, go through it together — can be student driven if someone volunteers)

1. Review last week's material: instructors go around the room individually and check in with students, make note of recurring questions. Pose quick, popcorn-style questions on topics from last week: verbal, whiteboard, code on the projector. Go over answers together.
2. High level discussion of functions: what they are, how to use them.
3. Discuss named vs anonymous functions — pros and cons.
4. Using parameters
5. Statement blocks
6. Callbacks & Chaining
7. Briefly touch on recursion, more as an explainer than for practical use (will get deeper in later weeks)
8. Discuss homework


## Review

1. if statement
2. switch statement
3. for loop
4. while loop


## Let's talk about Functions

A function is a contained set of instructions.
