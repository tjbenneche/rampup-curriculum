# Functions

## Class Workflow

The flow for each individual topic should be as follows:
- Discuss high level overview: why it matters, how it fits in to overall goals, why we're learning it in this order
- Explain logic via pseudo-code, either on whiteboard or projector.
- Live code example as a group
- Individual exercises
- Group exercise (pick one of the more challenging individual exercises, go through it together — can be student driven if someone volunteers)

1. Review last week's material: instructors go around the room individually and check in with students, make note of recurring questions. Pose quick, popcorn-style questions on topics from last week: verbal, whiteboard, code on the projector. Go over answers together.
2. High level discussion of functions: what they are, how to use them.
3. Discuss named vs anonymous functions — pros and cons.
4. Using parameters
5. Statement blocks
6. Callbacks & Chaining
7. Briefly touch on recursion, more as an explainer than for practical use (will get deeper in later weeks)
8. Discuss homework


## Review

1. if statement
2. switch statement
3. for loop
4. while loop


## Let's talk about Functions

A function is a contained set of instructions.

### Naming

There are two ways to invoke a function in JavaScript, with a _name_ or _anonymously_. Functions can use their names to call themselves again (recursion), and can be referenced in other parts of your code via their names.

	//anonymous
	(function (){
    	alert('hello world!');
    })();
    
    //named
    function helloWorld(){
    	alert('hello world!);
    };
    
    helloWorld();

## Parameters

Parameters allow functions to be _generic_, meaning they can be invoked repeatedly using different data. So we can expand on our function defined above to accept lots of diferent messages:

	function alert(message){
    	alert(message);
    }
    
    alert("hello world!");
    alert("goodbye cruel world!");
