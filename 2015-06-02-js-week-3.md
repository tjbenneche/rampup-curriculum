# Functions

## Class Workflow

The flow for each individual topic should be as follows:
- Discuss high level overview: why it matters, how it fits in to overall goals, why we're learning it in this order
- Explain logic via pseudo-code, either on whiteboard or projector.
- Live code example as a group
- Individual exercises
- Group exercise (pick one of the more challenging individual exercises, go through it together — can be student driven if someone volunteers)

1. Review last week's material: instructors go around the room individually and check in with students, make note of recurring questions. Pose quick, popcorn-style questions on topics from last week: verbal, whiteboard, code on the projector. Go over answers together.
2. High level discussion of functions: what they are, how to use them.
3. Discuss named vs anonymous functions — pros and cons.
4. Using parameters
5. Statement blocks
6. Callbacks
7. Briefly touch on recursion, more as an explainer than for practical use (will get deeper in later weeks)
8. Discuss homework

## Let's talk about Functions

A function is a contained set of instructions.

### Naming

There are two ways to invoke a function in JavaScript, with a _name_ or _anonymously_. Functions can use their names to call themselves again (recursion), and can be referenced in other parts of your code via their names.

	//anonymous
	(function (){
    	alert('hello world!');
    })();
    
    //named
    function helloWorld(){
    	alert('hello world!);
    };
    
    helloWorld();

## Parameters

Parameters allow functions to be _generic_, meaning they can be invoked repeatedly using different data. So we can expand on our function defined above to accept lots of diferent messages:

	function alert(message){
    	alert(message);
    }
    
    alert("hello world!");
    alert("goodbye cruel world!");

## Statements

Everything inside the curly braces {} of a function declaration are statements. These include everything we've covered in the previous two classes: _variables_, _if statements_, _switch statements_, _for loops_, _while loops_, etc.

These are the procedural instructions the computer will follow when the function is called.

Let's create a function that expands a bit on the "alert" defined in the previous section:

	function greeting(name, case){
    	if (case == "hello"){
        	var _message = "Hi" + name + ", how are you today?";
        else{
        	var _message = "Bye" + name + ", nice seeing you!";
        }
        alert(_message);
    }
    
    greeting("Tom", "hello");
    

        

## Callbacks


## Recursion

Recursion is repeatedly calling a function from itself until a base case is reached. This technique can be used when an answer to a problem is dependent on answers to a simpler version of said problem. There are two crucial components to writing a recursive function: a base case, and a recursive call (a call to itself)

A great example of where to use recursion is the **Fibonacci Sequence**, where an element in the set is defined as the sum of the previous two elements.

### Fibonacci's Numbers
