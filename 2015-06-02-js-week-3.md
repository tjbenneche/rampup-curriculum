# Functions

## Class Workflow

The flow for each individual topic should be as follows:
- Discuss high level overview: why it matters, how it fits in to overall goals, why we're learning it in this order
- Explain logic via pseudo-code, either on whiteboard or projector.
- Live code example as a group
- Individual exercises
- Group exercise (pick one of the more challenging individual exercises, go through it together — can be student driven if someone volunteers)

1. Review last week's material: instructors go around the room individually and check in with students, make note of recurring questions. Pose quick, popcorn-style questions on topics from last week: verbal, whiteboard, code on the projector. Go over answers together.
2. High level discussion of functions: what they are, how to use them.
3. Discuss named vs anonymous functions — pros and cons.
4. Using parameters
5. Statement blocks
6. Callbacks
7. Briefly touch on recursion, more as an explainer than for practical use (will get deeper in later weeks)
8. Discuss homework


## Review

1. if statement
2. switch statement
3. for loop
4. while loop


## What Are Functions and Why Do We Use Them?

A function is effectively a container holding a set of instructions. Sometimes functions are _anonymous_, and only meant to be used once, but more often than not we give them names to be referenced at a later point in our program. A good function is _generic_, meaning it uses placeholder variables (called _parameters_) so that it can be called multiple times with different data.

Take, for instance, a _sum_ function:

	function sum(a,b){
    	return a + b;
    }

This function uses two _parameters_, a and b, to serve as placeholders until the function is called with real data passed in. Once this function is defined, we can call it as many times as we'd like with any arbitrary data:

	sum(8,2);
    
    sum('hello', 'world');
    
    sum([1,2,3],[4,5,6]);
    
There may be many times in a program where we are adding two pieces of data together, so rather than writing that same line "return a + b" over and over again, we can define a function sum(a,b) once, and use it repeatedly.

A libraries like jQuery is basically a big collection of functions. It does quite a bit more than that, but one of the big value-adds is its extensive set of pre-written functions. When we define named functions in our JavaScript programs, we are effectively building a small "library" for our reference. 

### Declaration

Using functions is a two-step process: declaring them and calling them. When we _delcare_ (or define) a function, we create our block of instructions. When we later go to _call_ them is when the program actually executes that set of instructions.

A function declaration is made up of three required pieces and one optional one:

1. The reserved word _function_
2. The name you decide to give it
3. (Optional) placeholder parameters
4. Block of code to execute (the instructions)



### Calling

## Parameters

Parameters allow functions to be _generic_, meaning they can be invoked repeatedly using different data. So we can expand on our function defined above to accept lots of diferent messages:

	function alert(message){
    	alert(message);
    }
    
    alert("hello world!");
    alert("goodbye cruel world!");

## Statements

Everything inside the curly braces {} of a function declaration are statements. These include everything we've covered in the previous two classes: _variables_, _if statements_, _switch statements_, _for loops_, _while loops_, etc.

These are the procedural instructions the computer will follow when the function is called.

Let's create a function that expands a bit on the "alert" defined in the previous section:

	function greeting(name, case){
    	if (case == "hello"){
        	var _message = "Hi" + name + ", how are you today?";
        else{
        	var _message = "Bye" + name + ", nice seeing you!";
        }
        alert(_message);
    }
    
    greeting("Tom", "hello");
    
Let's create a function called _sum_ that takes in two numbers as parameters and alerts the result:

	function sum(a,b){
    	alert(a+b);
   	}
