# CSS3: Delighting with Animation

Since this is the last week before presentations, the primary objective of this class should be ensuring students have a firm grasp on the fundamentals and are set up to finish their projects. There will likely be a need to review concepts from last week's responsive class, as that is a lot to cover in just one week.

With what time remains, the next material to dive into is the wonderful world of CSS3. Where JavaScript long reigned supreme, CSS has made great strides in animating and transforming HTML elements. We will limit the scope of this class to Transitions and Transforms, but [Keyframes](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/05/17/an-introduction-to-css3-keyframe-animations/) are an increidbly powerful new resource also available in CSS3.

PSA: with animation becoming so accessible, we run the risk of a ressurgeance of 90s era [blink](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blink) and [marquee](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee) horror (or glory, depending on your sense of humor). So, a general rule of thumb: use css animations to create small delights or powerful visualizations, but use them sparingly and try to steer clear of over-designing. Or don't, and maybe you'll create something [amazing](http://buttzlol.com/) and [hilarious](http://art.yale.edu/).

## Transforms

The _transform_ property allows you to modify an element's position or appearance, with values including: translate, rotate, scale, and skew.

## Homework

Final presentations are next week! Make as much progress on your projects as possible, and try to get them to a point where you are comfortable sharing with the class. Don't worry about "finishing", as you'll quickly learn that projects on the web are never really finished. These presentations are not for a grade, and your completion of the class is not contingent on a finished project. But take this opportunity to clean up your code, polish your design, and formalize for yourself what you've learned in class. Presentations will be brief: show off your site, explain choices you made in code and design, and share how you'd like to expand on it going forward.
