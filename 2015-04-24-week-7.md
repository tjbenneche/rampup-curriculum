# CSS3: Delighting with Animation

Since this is the last week before presentations, the primary objective of this class should be ensuring students have a firm grasp on the fundamentals and are set up to finish their projects. There will likely be a need to review concepts from last week's responsive class, as that is a lot to cover in just one week.

With what time remains, the next material to dive into is the wonderful world of CSS3. Where JavaScript long reigned supreme, CSS has made great strides in animating and transforming HTML elements. We will limit the scope of this class to Transitions and Transforms, but [Keyframes](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/05/17/an-introduction-to-css3-keyframe-animations/) are an increidbly powerful new resource also available in CSS3.

PSA: with animation becoming so accessible, we run the risk of a ressurgeance of 90s era [blink](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blink) and [marquee](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/marquee) horror (or glory, depending on your sense of humor). So, a general rule of thumb: use css animations to create small delights or powerful visualizations, but use them sparingly and try to steer clear of over-designing. Or don't, and maybe you'll create something [amazing](http://buttzlol.com/) and [hilarious](http://art.yale.edu/).

## Transforms

The _transform_ property allows you to modify an element's position or appearance, with common values including _translate_ and _rotate_.

### Translate

Translating an element will change its position along the x or y axes, away from its origin. Like all coordinate calculations on the web, the higher the "x" value, the farther to the right, and the higher the "y" value, the farther toward the bottom of the page. Translations can be written as X and Y individually, or combining them in shorthand.

	div{
    	transform: translateX(50px) translateY(50px);
    }
    
    img{
    	transform: translate(50px, 50px);
    }

### Rotate

Adding a rotation to element will rotate it around its origin (its center, by default, though that can be changed with the _[transform_origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-origin))_ property. Like _translate_, _rotate_ can accept values for the x, y, and z axes (the z axis coming straight out of the page, in this case). Rather than pixels, rotate takes in degrees for its values.

	div{
    	//rotating around the x axis will move an element like a vertical card-flipper
    	transform: rotateX(90deg);
    }
    img{
    	//rotating around the y axis will spin an element like a top
    	transform: rotateY(90deg);
    }
    p{
    	//rotating around the z axis will move an alement in the plane of the screen, rotating like a windmill
        transform: rotateZ(90deg);
    }
    


## Transitions

Transitions are used to set the duration, and style of an animation. Outside of keyframes, transitions are the best way to create smooth animations in CSS. There are four component properties of transition: property name, duration, timing function, and delay. If no property is specified, the transition will be applied to all [animatable properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties) set on an element. Duration is set in seconds or miliseconds and specifies exactly how long a property change will take. Timing function dictates the style of the animation, though is not a requirement for setting one. Delay specifies the amount of time to wait before executing a property change and is also not required. Like many other CSS3 properties, there is a shorthand as well.

	div{
    	transition-property: left;
        transition-duration: .6s;
        transition-timing-function: linear;
        transition-delay: .3s;
    }
    img{
    	//shorthand
    	transition: all 2s ease-in-out .2s;
    }

Let's try setting a transition on background-color, and create a nice hover effect on a button:

## Homework

Final presentations are next week! Make as much progress on your projects as possible, and try to get them to a point where you are comfortable sharing with the class. Don't worry about "finishing", as you'll quickly learn that projects on the web are never really finished. These presentations are not for a grade, and your completion of the class is not contingent on a finished project. But take this opportunity to clean up your code, polish your design, and formalize for yourself what you've learned in class. Presentations will be brief: show off your site, explain choices you made in code and design, and share how you'd like to expand on it going forward.
