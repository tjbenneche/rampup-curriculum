# CSS3: Delighting with Animation

Since this is the last week before presentations, the primary objective of this class should be ensuring students have a firm grasp on the fundamentals and are set up to finish their projects. There will likely be a need to review concepts from last week's responsive class, as that is a lot to cover in just one week.

With what time remains, the next material to dive into is the wonderful world of CSS3. Where JavaScript long reigned supreme, CSS has made great strides in animating and transforming HTML elements. We will limit the scope of this class to Transitions and Transforms, but [Keyframes](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/05/17/an-introduction-to-css3-keyframe-animations/) are an increidbly powerful new resource also available in CSS3.

## Transforms

The _transform_ property allows you to modify an element's position or appearance, with values including: translate, rotate, scale, and skew.
