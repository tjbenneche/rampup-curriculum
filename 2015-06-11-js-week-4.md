# JavaScript on The Web

We've covered quite a few fundamental topics at this point, and it's finally time to start applying those in JavaScript's natural environment: the web.

## Getting Started

Before we begin writing the necessary JavaScript, we need to set up a project directory where all our documents will live, then link them together.

### Creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Documents

    |   ├── main.js
    
Above is a typical file tree setup. You'll notice at the top is a dot — this is a Unix convention. One dot represents your working directory (the folder you are currently in), and two dots represent the parent directory (the folder above yours in a vertical tree). At the root (base) level of our directory, we have an index.html file — this is the homepage of our site, the one our web server (once the site is live) will serve up by default. At the same level as index.html are two directories: _css_ (where our styles live) and _js_ (where our sripts live).

**HTML**

HTML (hypertext markup language) contains the structure and content of a web page. An HTML document is broken up into two parts: the head and the body. Imagine these two as sections of a house:

![](/img/house.png)

The head is the attic: while there are important things stored away up there, no its contents are invisible to visitors of the house. Everything within the body tags, however, is the visible content of the web page — the elements seen by visitors. The head may contain links to CSS documents, meta tags, the page title, etc — whereas the body contains visible elements like images, headinigs, paragraphs, hyperlinks, videos, and so on.

	<!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
          <head>
              <title>My Website</title>
              <meta charset="utf-8">
              <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
          </head>
          <body>
              <h1>Hello World</h1>
              <p>it me!</p>
              <script type="text/javascript" src="js/main.js"></script>
          </body>
      </html>
      
**CSS**

CSS (cascading style sheets) contains the style rules defined for a page. Within CSS rules you can specify rules for HTML elements by using selectors. Selectors may be tag names (p, a, div, etc.), classes, or IDs (more on those later). After specifying which selector to target, you define various style rules (color, size, position, etc) within curly braces.

	body{
        background-color: blue;
        font-size: 10px;
    }
    p,a{
        font-size: 1.6rem;
    }
    h1{
        font-size: 2.2rem;
        font-weight: 600;
    }

## Targeting DOM Elements



### By Tag Name

The most basic way to target an HTML element is by its tag name. This function will return an array containing **all** elements with a tag name matching the one specified.

Let's create an array of all _p_ tags on the page:

	var _fullList = document.getElementsByTagName('p');

### By Class

To get a little more specific, you can target an element by its class name. Classes are generally used in HTML to apply the same set of style rules to many similar elements. Imagine a blog: each div representing a post might have a class called "blog-post", so that way in CSS, the style rules for a blog post only need to get specified once.

	var _evens = document.getElementsByClassName('even');
   

### By ID

If we want to target just one element, we can do so by its ID. By definition, an ID should only appear once on any given web page. To expand on our previous example, if we wanted to have a "featured post" in our blog, that element may contain a unique ID along with the class "blog-post". This way it will inherit all the shared styles, and its unique features can be specified for its ID.  

	var _tenth = document.getElementById('tenth)';


    
## Native JavaScript Functions

All languages contain an assortment of "native functions", meaning they work out of the box with no frameworks or libraries needed. The functions used above to get DOM elements are native, as are the following three below. It's no surprise that in addition to standard programming functions, JavaScript's native functions tend to deal with manipulating content on the web.

### click

The click function is twofold: it can trigger a click on an element, or specify a function to fire off when an element is clicked.

	var _tenth = document.getElementById('tenth)';
    _tenth.click();
    
Or, to specify some action:

	var _tenth = document.getElementById('tenth)';
    _tenth.click(function(){
    	alert('Tenth element');
    });

### parseInt

This function turns a string into a number, and is very helpful when you need to do a calculation on something that's been parsed from a string.

### css

This function allows us to _get_ or _set_ CSS properties on an HTML element.

	var _tenth = document.getElementById('tenth)';
    _tenth.css('background-color', 'red');
    
## Building Basic Web Functions

Let's combine some of the native functions provided by JavaScript, and the functions and statements learned in the past few weeks to create some custom web functions.
