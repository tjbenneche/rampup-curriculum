# Functions in JavaScript

## Outcomes

1. Students should understand the syntax and implementation of of Objects and Arrays.
2. Students should be able to create functions and pass in data via parameters.
3. Students should be able to incorporate statements and loops from the previous module into new, complex functions.

**Importance**

Objects are the most important data type in JavaScript, as almost all other types inherit from them. With a deeper understanding of Objects and Arrays, students should be able to write more powerful loops and functions.

With functions, we can write code blocks that can be executed after certain events (click, scroll, load, etc). By using parameters in these functions, we can make them more generic and reusable.

### Object

In JavaScript, everything besides the simple data types is an **Object**. An object is a container of key/value pairs. A key (or name) is a string, and its corresponding value can be any data type other than _undefined_.

An **Object Literal** is the most common type of object, denoted as key/value pairs separated by colons, all within curly brackets:

	var _car = {
    	"model": "Corvette",
        "color": "red",
        "year": 2015
    }

There are two ways to access data from an object — **bracket notation** and **dot notation**:

	// bracket notation
	var _model = _car["model"];
    
    // dot notation
    var _model = _car.model;
    
    
### Arrays

An array is a simple indexed list of elements. Since it is technically treated as an object in JavaScript, you can think of it as an object whose keys are integers 0-n (n being the number of elements minus 1) as strings. Arrays are declared as comma-separated values within square brackets.

So, this array:

	var _yearArray = [2015, 2014, 2013];
    
is effectively the same as this object:

	var _yearObject = {
    	"0": 2015,
        "1": 2014,
        "2": 2013
    }
    
The main difference with an array is that there are many more methods available than with a standard object.

To access data in an array, you use bracket notation with the index of the element you would like to retrieve. To find the "ith" element of an array, you would do this:

	var _array = ["a", "b", "c"];
    _array[i];
    
where "i" is any integer value between 0 and n (n being length of array minus 1).

The length of an array (or the number of elements it contains) can be retrieved by this method:

	var _array = ["a", "b", "c"];
    _array.length;

## Let's talk about Functions

A function is a contained set of instructions.

### Naming

There are two ways to invoke a function in JavaScript, with a _name_ or _anonymously_. Functions can use their names to call themselves again (recursion), and can be referenced in other parts of your code via their names.

	//anonymous
	(function (){
    	alert('hello world!');
    })();
    
    //named
    function helloWorld(){
    	alert('hello world!);
    };
    
    helloWorld();

## Parameters

Parameters allow functions to be _generic_, meaning they can be invoked repeatedly using different data. So we can expand on our function defined above to accept lots of diferent messages:

	function alert(message){
    	alert(message);
    }
    
    alert("hello world!");
    alert("goodbye cruel world!");

## Statements

Everything inside the curly braces {} of a function declaration are statements. These include everything we've covered in the previous two classes: _variables_, _if statements_, _switch statements_, _for loops_, _while loops_, etc.

These are the procedural instructions the computer will follow when the function is called.

Let's create a function that expands a bit on the "alert" defined in the previous section:

	function greeting(name, case){
    	if (case == "hello"){
        	var _message = "Hi" + name + ", how are you today?";
        else{
        	var _message = "Bye" + name + ", nice seeing you!";
        }
        alert(_message);
    }
    
    greeting("Tom", "hello");
