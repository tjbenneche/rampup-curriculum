# A Deeper Look at Styling with CSS

## Class Workflow Overview

1. Selectors & Specificity - discuss the different types of CSS selectors, where it is appropriate to use which, and the hierarchy of specificity.
2. Discuss your typical workflow, whether it is writing all the HTML before styling, or doing them side by side — what are the costs and benefits of different methods?
3. Writing HTML with CSS in mind: logical grouping of elements, assigning classes and IDs before the syle rules even exist to ensure efficiency in your CSS.
4. Review the basics: typography, color, any superficial style properties .

## A note before we begin:

Hopefully some of this content will have at least been touched upon in weeks 1 and 2, but this week will go much more in depth.

Students should, at this point, have at least two documents created: an HTML file called index.html, and a CSS file called style.css. The HTML doc should link to the CSS one, though right now there may only be a few style rules declared. In week 1 we demonstrated how to target (or "select") an HTML element in CSS in order to declare a style rule, but what we'll learn in this class is that selecting an element by its tag name (i.e. div, p, a, etc...) is rarely the best option.


## Selectors & Specifity

### Selectors

There are four distinct ways to select an HTML element in CSS: by inline styles, tag name, class, or ID (and various combinations of these). We use these "selectors" to tell the browser to which element the following style rules should be applied.

Let's take a closer look at each of these.

**Inline Styles**

An inline style is where you declare a style rule within the tag of the HTML element you are trying to style, like so:

	<p style="color:red;">This paragraph is red.</p>
    
As we discussed in week 1, this method — while technically fine — violates the principle of Separation of Concerns. In order to keep our code readable and easy to maintain, we should avoid inline styles and write our style rules in a separate CSS document.

**Tag Name**

Selecting an element by its tag name will apply the following style rules to any element sharing that same tag. So, if in your CSS you have something like this:

	p{
    	color:red;
     }

all "<p>" elements in your HTML document will be colored red. This method only makes sense if you are declaring a style you intend to be universal — perhaps you want to remove the default margin on all paragraphs, or make all headings the same font size. Otherwise, it is more effective to add some specifity to your selectors by including a class or ID.

**Class**

A class selector can be used to apply a set of style rules to multiple elements on the page. Let's say you had a long list of paragraph tags and wanted to alternate the background color of each, you could apply the class "odd" to the first and every other tag following, and likewise give all even tags the
class "even".

	<p class="odd">One</p>
    <p class="even">Two</p>
    <p class="odd">Three</p>
    <p class="even">Four</p>

Then in your CSS, rather than selecting the elements by their tag name, p, you can use their respective class selectors:

	.odd{
    	background-color:blue;
    }
    
    .even{
    	background-color:red;
    }
    
You'll notice that the class selectors in CSS have a dot before the name — this is the way of telling the browser that this word represents a class. A similar convention is used to denote when an ID is being used as well.

**ID**

An ID selector is used to apply a set of style rules to _one_ element on the page. As a rule, IDs should be used sparingly as they hold a much greater weight than classes, and as such are difficult to override. An ID should be applied to no more than one element per page, as having multiple instances of the same ID could cause problems in JavaScript and semantically an ID should be unique.

One of the more common usecases for an ID is as an anchor tag. If you've encountered a website where clicking on a navigation link scrolls you down to a different section of the page rather than directing you to a totally new page, the odds are this is being done using ID anchors. Anchor setups generally look something like this:

	<a href="#section2">Section 2</a>
    
   	...
    
    <div id="section2">
    ...
    </div>

The "href" attribute specifies the URL or path to which the link should take you. When an href value starts with a "#", the hyperlink will search the current document for an ID matching whatever text comes after. If no text is provided and we just have

	<a href="#">Link</a>

the link will take you nowhere. This is often used when a link's destination is the page you're currently on (i.e. a "Home" link on the homepage).

Another use for IDs is when there is truly something unique on the page that requires styling. Let's say you were building a blog, and wanted to have a different style treatment for the most recent post. All posts will share similar styles, but the most recent one will have a larger font size. Your HTML might look something like this:

	<article class="blog-post" id="most-recent">
    ...
    </article>
    
    <article class="blog-post">
    ...
    </article>
    
    <article class="blog-post">
    ...
    </article>

You'll notice each article tag is given a class of "blog-post", but only the first has the ID of "most-recent". This setup will allow us to write style rules shared by all posts and rules that only get applied to the most recent one, like so:

	.blog-post{
    	color:blue;
        margin:20px 0;
        font-size:16px;
    }
    
    #most-recent{
    	font-size:24px;
    }
    
In this setup, each article will have a font color of blue, some margin on the top and bottom for spacing, and a font size of 16px. The article with id="most-recent", however, will have its font size increased to 24px because IDs are weighted more heavily than classes.


### Specifity

A style rule's precendence is measured in specificity. Each of the selector types mentioned above has a _specifity value_.

An inline style, given that it is placed directly within the HTML tag, has the highest specifity value of all the selector types. When a style rule is changed via JavaScript, it is done with the inline style method, and as such will override any previously declared styles. The next highest value is an ID, followed by a class, and finally a tag name. Keep in mind that to make a style rule more specific, you can (and often should) use combinations of these selectors.

How do we calculate specifity?

An inline style has a specificity value of **1000**
An ID selector has a specificity value of **100**
A class selector has a specificity value of **10**
A tag name selector has a specificity value of **1**

Let's try setting some style rules for this paragraph:

	<html>
    	<head>
        </head>
        
        <body>
        	<div class="container">
            	<p id="special">This is the paragraph to be styled</p>
            </div>
        </body>
    </html>

As we've done in the past, we could simply use the "p" tag name:

	p{
    	color:red;
    }
    
This style rule has a specifity value of 1, since all we are using is the tag name. Let's make this a little more specific to override that style:

	div p{
    	color:blue;
    }

By nesting the p selector within its parent div, we've increased the specifity value to 2, and the color will now show as blue. If we were to take this a step further and nest "div p" within all the remaining parent elements, "html body div p", the best we could do is a specificity value of 4. By using just one class selector, we can override that:

	.container p{
    	color:green;
    }
    
Rather than selecting any p within a div, we are now specifiying that these rules should only apply to p tags within an element with the class "container", resulting in a specificity value of 11. Let's try using an ID:

	#special{
    	color:yellow;
    }
    
By using an ID selector, we have increased our specifity value to 100, and the color of this paragraph will most certainly be yellow.

It is also important to note that because the browser interprets your CSS document from top to bottom, if two style rules have the same specificty value, whichever one comes later in the document will have precedence. So, if we have:

	div p{
    	color: red;
    }
    
    div p{
    	color: blue;
    }
    
the color will be blue.

Because there are so many different ways to select an element, the decision making process may seem a bit overwhelming at first. But, in reality, what matters is that you choose a system that makes sense to you. The only "rules" you want to keep in mind are these:

1. DRY - don't repeat yourself. Make an effort to minimize the lines of code you are writing. Use class selectors to write styles that can be shared across multiple elements.
2. KISS - keep it simple, stupid. Chris Coyer has a great application of this philosophy to CSS selectors: only be as specific _as it makes sense to be_. Don't write excessively long chains like "html body div.container .heading-box h1.primary" — instead, make it specific enough to work, and if you have to add more specificity later so be it.
3. Use IDs sparingly, and avoid inline styles altogether. Each of these has a tendency to break the "cascading" nature of CSS (cascading style sheets). When reading through code, it will be apparent which rules are more specific by the length of the selector chain preceding them. IDs and inline styles muddle these snap judgements that prove to be big time savers in debugging.

## Basic CSS Properties

This section will be brief in writing but lengthy in practice. Here are some basic properties to get you started — as a group and in individual exercises, we should practice making these changes to our pages.

### Typography

**font-size** — this changes the font size for your web page. The standard body font size is 16px, and for now we can just focus on pixel sizes. Later on we will discuss ems and rems, more responsive and efficient units for declaring font size.

**color** — this will change the text color.

**line-height** — if you'd like to add some space to the top and bottom of text without using padding, consider setting a line-height value slightly higher than the font-size.

**font-family** - this is where you set the actual font of your text, and the style (serif, sans serif, etc). For now you can play around with standard web-safe fonts like Arial, Helvetica, etc — later we will discuss how to include web fonts on your page (this opens up a much wider variety of font options).

**text-align** — this sets the horizontal alignment of text. Possible values are left, right, and center.

**text-decoration** — this is used to add or remove an underline. All "a" tags by default have an underline to show that they are links — to remove this you could set text-decoration to "none".

### Other Properties

**width** — this is where you set the width of an element. Widths can be fixed values (set in px or em or rem), or percentage values (%) which will change as a user resizes their browser window. Percentage values will be a cornerstone in building responsive sites.

**height** — like width, this sets the height of an element.

**background-color** — this sets the background color of an element.

**margin** — this is used to set space between elements. Margins can be added to all sides, a pair of sides (top/bottom, left/right), or an individual side. Like so:
	
    div{
    	// this will apply 20px margin to all sides
    	margin: 20px
    }
    
    div{
    	// this will apply 20px margin to the top and bottom, and 10px margin to the left and right
        margin:20px 10px;
    }
    
    div{
    	// this will apply 20px margin to just the left side
        margin-left:20px;
    }

**padding** — like margin, padding has the same ways of being applied to various sides. Padding adds space within the bounds of an element, rather than outside or between elements. A good example of the difference would be in creating a colored button. Because padding exists within an element, background color applies to it.

**border** — this adds a border around the edge of an element. You specify the width of the border, the style, and the color, like so:

	div{
    	border:2px solid green;
    }
    
Obviously this is not a comprehensive list of styles. That would be a frivolous exercise to write them all out when there are phenomenal docs available at [Mozilla](developer.mozilla.org) and the [W3](http://www.w3.org/). You'll find that googling "how to change [xyz property] in CSS" will be the quickest way to figure out how to style something, via Mozilla, CSS-tricks, and StackOverflow search results.


## Lab/Homework

Now that we have a solid grasp on the relationship between HTML and CSS, and know how to change a few basic style properties, let's start styling our project sites. We have not covered layout yet (that will be next week), but you can start building out the content in HTML (and remembering to logically group elements based on how they will eventually be laid out) and setting some preliminary styles.
