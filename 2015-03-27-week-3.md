# A Deeper Look at Styling with CSS

## Class Workflow Overview

1. Selectors & Specificity - discuss the different types of CSS selectors, where it is appropriate to use which, and the hierarchy of specificity.
2. Discuss your typical workflow, whether it is writing all the HTML before styling, or doing them side by side — what are the costs and benefits of different methods?
3. Writing HTML with CSS in mind: logical grouping of elements, assigning classes and IDs before the syle rules even exist to ensure efficiency in your CSS.
2. Review the basics: typography, color, any superficial style properties
3. Introduce more advanced styles: display, margin/padding, width/height, 

## A note before we begin:

Hopefully some of this content will have at least been touched upon in weeks 1 and 2, but this week will go much more in depth.

Students should, at this point, have at least two documents created: an HTML file called index.html, and a CSS file called style.css. The HTML doc should link to the CSS one, though right now there may only be a few style rules declared. In week 1 we demonstrated how to target (or "select") an HTML element in CSS in order to declare a style rule, but what we'll learn in this class is that selecting an element by its tag name (i.e. div, p, a, etc...) is rarely the best option.


## Selectors & Specifity

There are four distinct ways to select an HTML element in CSS: by inline styles, tag name, class, or ID (and various combinations of these). We use these "selectors" to tell the browser to which element the following style rules should be applied. Any given style rule's precendence is measured in specificity.

What do we mean by specificity?
