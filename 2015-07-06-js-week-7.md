# Data Manipulation

1. Ajax
2. Iterating through (.each)
3. DOM manipulation (append, insertafter insertbefore)

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML — though the name is somewhat misleading, as most AJAX requests deal with data formats other than XML, like JSON and HTML. At its core, it is used to request data to or from a server without reloading the page (e.g. how Facebook refreshes your newsfeed or Gmail fetches new emails). It does this via the XMLHttpRequest API, which consists of a number of different types of requests (depending on whether or not you are trying to receive or post data). For the purposes of this class, we will focus on two: GET and POST.

For the most part, AJAX requests only work if the request is coming from the [same origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy) as the data, though there has been some movement toward [Cross-Origin data sharing as of late](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing). This means that for us to interact with data — since our sites are not hosted live on a server — we need to download a JSON file locally and include it in our projects.

### HTTP requests

### GET

### POST

### PUT

.html


## Callbacks

$.get( "myhtmlpage.html", myCallBack );

Executing callbacks with arguments can be tricky.

link Wrong

This code example will not work:

1
$.get( "myhtmlpage.html", myCallBack( param1, param2 ) );
The reason this fails is that the code executes myCallBack( param1, param2 ) immediately and then passes myCallBack()'s return value as the second parameter to $.get(). We actually want to pass the function myCallBack(), not myCallBack( param1, param2 )'s return value (which might or might not be a function). So, how to pass in myCallBack() and include its arguments?

link Right

To defer executing myCallBack() with its parameters, you can use an anonymous function as a wrapper. Note the use of function() {. The anonymous function does exactly one thing: calls myCallBack(), with the values of param1 and param2.

$.get( "myhtmlpage.html", function() {
 
    myCallBack( param1, param2 );
 
});


## Waiting for DOM to load

This function is slightly better than the original JavaScript one, as it will run as soon as the DOM is ready to manipulated, rather than waiting for all images to load.
$(document).ready(function(){

});

window.onload = function() {
 
    alert( "welcome" );
 
};



## .load()

insert HTML directly into matched element
