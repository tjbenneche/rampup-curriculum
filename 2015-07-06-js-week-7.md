# Data Manipulation

## Class Workflow
1. Ajax
2. Iterating through (.each)
3. DOM manipulation (append, insertafter insertbefore)

## AJAX

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML — though the name is somewhat misleading, as most AJAX requests deal with data formats other than XML, like JSON and HTML. At its core, it is used to request data to or from a server without reloading the page (e.g. how Facebook refreshes your newsfeed or Gmail fetches new emails). It does this via the XMLHttpRequest API, which consists of a number of different types of requests (depending on whether or not you are trying to receive or post data). For the purposes of this class, we will focus on two: GET and POST.

For the most part, AJAX requests only work if the request is coming from the [same origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy) as the data, though there has been some movement toward [Cross-Origin data sharing as of late](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing). This means that for us to interact with data — since our sites are not hosted live on a server — we need to download a JSON file locally and include it in our projects.

## .ajax()

.ajax() is jQuery's native function for handling http requests. There are more specific functions as well such as .get() and .post(), but the results of each of those can be accomplished using the parent .ajax() function on its own.

### HTTP requests

An HTTP (HyperText Transfor Protocol) request is the act of a _client_ requesting to post/receive data to/from a web server. That client may be a web browser (as is the case in our pursuits), a mobile app, a terminal, etc. The two most common types of requests are GET and POST, the two we will be focusing on today. Other common requests are HEAD (same as GET but without the actual body/data, so useful for retrieving meta-data), PUT (used for updating an existing resource), and DELETE (deletes the specified resource).

### GET

A GET request is a message to a server requesting a representation of a _specific resource_, and should _only_ retrieve data, never post it.

	$.ajax({
    	method: "GET",
        url: "data/baseball.json",
        dataType: "json"
    });
        

### POST

A POST request is a message to a server requesting that it accept data as a subset of the specified URI.

	$.ajax({
  		method: "POST",
  		url: "data/baseball.json",
  		data: { team1: "Mets", team1_score: "3", team2: "Cardinals", team2_score: "1", innings: "18" }
	})
  	.done(function() {
    	alert( "Planet added");
  	});

## DOM Manipulation

**.html()**

The [.html() function](http://api.jquery.com/html/) replaces the entire HTML content of the selected element with whatever data is passed in:

	$('.div').html('<p>This p tag will replace all current contents of all divs</p>');
    
**.insertAfter()**

The .insertAfter() function inserts the data passed in directly into the DOM after the selected element:

	$( "<p>This p will be inserted after element with class last</p>" ).insertAfter( ".last" );

## Callbacks

Perhaps we want to manipulate some DOM elements _after_ data has been retrieved via an AJAX request (in fact, this is very often the case). By JavaScript's nature, code will continue to execute while an AJAX request is in progress. As a result of this, we might try to add data to the page before the data even exists. To make use of the _asynchronous_ part of AJAX and only run code once a request has been completed, we can use a callback!

	function getPlanets() {
      $.ajax({
          method: 'GET',
          url : '/data/baseball.json',
          success : createBoxScore
      })
  	}
    
    function createBoxScore(){
    	//some code here
    }
    
Now, using the "success" parameter and callback function, the data won't get inserted onto the page until it all has been loaded.


## Waiting for DOM to load

In a similar vein to callbacks, there may times where we need to wait for the entire document to load before executing certain code. jQuery has a great .ready() function that is actually slightly more performant than the pure JS one — as it will run as soon as the DOM is ready to be manipulated, rather than waiting for all images and video and scripts to render.

    $(document).ready(function(){
    	alert( "welcome" );
    });
    
    window.onload = function() {
        alert( "welcome" );
    };

## Homework

1. Use AJAX to pull data from baseball.json file, loops and conditionals to parse through the data and set corresponding variables.
2. Use jQUery to insert elements onto the page displaying the results of the game.
3. Use AJAX to post the results of another game, and then display those results as well.
