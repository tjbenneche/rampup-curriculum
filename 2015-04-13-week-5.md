# Group & Individual Project Work Session

As we are halfway through the course, it is now a good time to take a step back from instruction and focus on our projects. If the entire class is working on the same project, this will be largely an individual work session, with instructors going person-to-person and assisting. If there are many different projects, students should group up by project to help each other and discuss ideas.

By this point in the course, students should have enough exposure to HTML and CSS to build a basic version of their projects. That said, a lot of material has been covered over the past few weeks and there will certainly be need for some review: **Instructors** — as you're walking around the room and helping, if you notice recurring questions or confusion over a certain topic, take some time to review with the whole class. Make sure students' code is adhering to best practices and formatted correctly.

As you're building out your projects, you will likely reach roadblocks or decide to do things a bit differently than you had mapped out in your wireframes. This is fine, and totally expected. One of the benefits of using a low-fidelity design mockup like a wireframe is that it's relatively painless to make quick or even substantial changes to your design on the fly.

While you're working on your own or in groups, be sure to write down questions you have or things you're stuck on so that your instructor can help you sort them out.

## Homework

Next week we will begin responsive design, and discuss the ways to make your sites behave well across all devices. For homework this week, try to get your sites fully built out and mostly styled (with a focus on structure — aesthetic polish can come later). Also review your mobile wireframes, and make any changes that might be necessary now that you've done some development. Sketch out a couple in-between states as well: how will it look on a tablet? on a small desktop browser?
