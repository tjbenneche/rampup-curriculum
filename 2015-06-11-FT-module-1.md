## Introduction to JavaScript


## Syntax
 
### Semicolons
 
In JavaScript, semicolons are used to separate statements, and are placed at the end of a line. Some common statements are variable declarations, assignments, and function calls. While semicolons are often not required, it is generally safer (and more efficient for the computer to parse) when they are included. They are _not needed_ after **if statements**, **for and while loops**, or **function definitions**.
 
### Variables
 
A variable is a symbolic name that can be used to store a value. As the term _variable_ suggests, this value can be changed. In JavaScript, when declaring a variable for the first time, its name is preceded by the word "var":
    
    var _name = "Tom";
    
If we wanted to update the value in this variable later on, "var" is no longer needed since the variable has already been declared into the **Namespace** (more on those later):
 
    _name = "Amy";
 
### Dynamic Typing
 
Because JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, data types are inferred from values rather than declared in variables. What this means is that a variable "year" can be declared as a number:
 
    var _year = 2015;
    
and later updated as a string:
 
    var _year = "2015";
    
JavaScript interprets the _type_ of this variable from the value stored in it. In statically typed languages, the initial variable declaration would need to include a class type, and updating to a different class would throw a type error. Take Java, for instance:
 
    var _year = new Integer;
    
    _year = 2015;
    
This dynamic assignment that JavaScript allows for makes a developer's life much easier.

## Data types

### String

Notice how the value we stored in the _name_ variable had quotes around it; those denote a data type called **String**. Strings can be wrapped in double or single quotes, the only governing rule being that they match (single with single, double with double). Let's declare a new string variable:

	var _year = "2015";

Because 2015 is wrapped in quotes, it is a string, not a **Number** — meaning mathematical operations cannot be performed on it. Strings can be added together or _concatenated_ by using the "+" operator:

	var _addedYear = "2" + "0" + "1" + "5";
    
Two strings are considered equal if they contain exactly the same characters, so:

	_year === _addedYear
    
would evaluate to _true_.

Give this is a try in the terminal!

### Number

Numbers in JavaScript are handled in a very straightforward fashion, as there is only one type. In many other languages, there is a distinction between _Integer_, _Float_, _Long_, _Double_, etc — all denoting different levels of accuracy (decimal points allowed). In JavaScript, you don't have to worry about any of that. 3 is equal to 3.0, and there will be no type errors thrown when trying to compare them.

Let's try setting some number variables and performing basic operations on them:

	var x = 10;
    var y = 0;
    
	// add them together and store in variable named "sum"
	var _sum = x + y;
    
    // substract them and store them in a variable named "diff"
    var _diff = x - y;
    
    // multiply them together and store them in a variable named "prod"
    var _prod = x * y;
    
    // divide them and store them in a variable named "quot"
    var _quot = x / y;

### Boolean

The two boolean values are _true_ and _false_. Booleans are very commonly used in conditional expressions, evaluating whether or not a condition is true before executing a function:

	var x = 5;
    if (x > 3) {
    	//do something
    }
    
Certain data types and expressions will always evaluate to either _true_ or _false_; the complete formula is outlined in the official JavaScript spec here:

[http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-9.2](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-9.2)


### Object

In JavaScript, everything besides the simple data types listed above is an **Object**. An object is a container of key/value pairs. A key (or name) is a string, and its corresponding value can be any data type other than _undefined_.

An **Object Literal** is the most common type of object, denoted as key/value pairs separated by colons, all within curly brackets:

	var _car = {
    	"model": "Corvette",
        "color": "red",
        "year": 2015
    }

There are two ways to access data from an object — **bracket notation** and **dot notation**:

	// bracket notation
	var _model = _car["model"];
    
    // dot notation
    var _model = _car.model;
    
    
### Arrays

An array is a simple indexed list of elements. Since it is technically treated as an object in JavaScript, you can think of it as an object whose keys are integers 0-n (n being the number of elements minus 1) as strings. Arrays are declared as comma-separated values within square brackets.

So, this array:

	var _yearArray = [2015, 2014, 2013];
    
is effectively the same as this object:

	var _yearObject = {
    	"0": 2015,
        "1": 2014,
        "2": 2013
    }
    
The main difference with an array is that there are many more methods available than with a standard object.

To access data in an array, you use bracket notation with the index of the element you would like to retrieve. To find the "ith" element of an array, you would do this:

	var _array = ["a", "b", "c"];
    _array[i];
    
where "i" is any integer value between 0 and n (n being length of array minus 1).

The length of an array (or the number of elements it contains) can be retrieved by this method:

	var _array = ["a", "b", "c"];
    _array.length;
    
    
## If Statements

An if statement executes a statement if its condition evaluates to true, and provides an _else_ statement for when the condition is false. As we talked about last week, this _condition_ is evaluating to a boolean value of either true or false.

	var x = 0;
    var y = 10;
    
    if (x > y){
    	alert(x + " is greater than " + y);
    else {
    	alert(y + " is greater than " + x);
    }

### else if

If there are more than two conditions to be evaluated, additional _if...else if_ statements can be included:

	var x = 0;
    var y = 10;
    
    if (x > y){
    	alert(x + " is greater than " + y);
    else if (x == y){
    	alert(x + " is equal to " + y);
    }
    else {
    	alert(y + " is greater than " + x);
    }
    
The greater than, less than, and double equals signs are called boolean comparison operators. Here is a [comprehensive list](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comparisons.asp) of all available boolean comparison operators.

You can also check if more than one condition is true, if a condition is not true, or if one of many conditions is true:

	//both true
    
    

## Switch Statements

A switch statement evaluates an expression compared to a defined set of _cases_. If it finds a match, the statements associated with that _case_ will be executed. The _break_ after each tells the program to kick out of the switch statement after the code for a matching case has been executed. If the _break_ is omitted, the program will execute statements for all the following cases as well, regardless of whether or not they match.

Let's try writing one for days of the week, alerting a different message 

	var _day = "Tuesday";
    switch (_day) {
    	case "Monday":
        	alert("Today is Monday");
            break;
        case "Tuesday":
        	alert("Today is Tuesday");
            break;
        case "Wednesday":
        	alert("Today is Wednesday");
            break;
        case "Thursday":
        	alert("Today is Thursday");
            break;
        case "Friday":
        	alert("Today is Friday");
            break;
        case "Saturday":
        	alert("Today is Saturday");
            break;
        case "Sunday":
        	alert("Today is Sunday");
            break;
        default:
        	alert("That is not a day of the week");
    }

## While Loops

A while loop continuously executes statements until the condition it's evaluating is no longer true. There must be some increment specified within the statement, otherwise you will have an infinite loop and your program will crash. 

	var _countdown = 10;
    var i = 0;
	while (_countdown > i) {
    	alert('Time left: ' + _countdown);
        _countdown -= 1;
    }

## For Loops

A for loop is effectively a special kind of while loop. The key differences are semantic:

1. A for loop can have a counter variable, condition to evaluate, and the increment in one line, which helps readability.
2. The counter variable can be declared _within_ the for loop, keeping it out of the global namespace.
3. While loops are technically indefinite at the time of compiling (though if written properly will at one point stop), whereas for loops have a finite number of iterations defined from the start.

Let's create a for loop that iterates through all the colors of the rainbow and outputs a message listing them:

	var _rainbow = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet'];
    var _message = "The colors of the rainbow are ";
    for (var i=0; i < _rainbow.length; i++) {
    	_message = _message + ', ' + _rainbow[i];
    }
    alert(_message);
