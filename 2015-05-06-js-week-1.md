# A Brief Introduction to Computer Programming

## Class Workflow

1. Set up students' computers: text editor, browser, dev folder, Slack, JavaScript console. Make sure everyone has access to the portal and exercises.
2. Discussion of programming landscape and where JavaScript fits in
3. Basic JavaScript syntax
4. Comments & Documentation: why it's important, best practices
5. Data types: syntax, practice creating simple and complex data types
6. Debugging: why it's important, how it works in JavaScript, introduction to the Web Inspector and JavaScript console
7. Introduce homework.

## Let's set up our machines:

1. Install your text-editor ([Atom](atom.io) or [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)) — both are good options. Sublime is an industry favorite, and Atom is a newcomer developed by Github (and is open source!).
2. Download Google Chrome — ultimately you'll want to test your sites on all major browsers (Firefox, IE, Safari, Mobile Safari, etc), but for development we recommend Chrome so we're all using the same web inspector.
3. Create a Development folder in the home directory of your computer. On a Mac, you can navigate to your home directory by right-clicking the title at the top of a Finder window, and selecting your username. On a PC, your home directory equivalent is the C drive. This is the folder where you can keep all your various web development projects, rather than cluttering up your desktop or documents.
4. Sign up for [Slack](slack.com) in the group set up by your instructor. Slack is an excellent tool for group communication, and can be used in RampUp for general announcements, questions, and discussion.
5. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (for mac), and run "brew install rhino" to set up [Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino). Rhino is a command-line interface for JavaScript which will allow us to write basic functions in the terminal.


## The Landscape

There is a plethora of programming languages in existence for countless purposes, and it's important for us to understand where JavaScript comes from and where it is headed.

JavaScript is a dynamic programming language designed primarily for client-side use on the web. It was created in the mid-90s to enrich the web with user interaction and asynchronous server communication, but took a number of years to become a supported standard in major web browsers.

It is a protoype-based language with dynamic typing (explained later), making it fairly unique in its support of both Object-Oriented (where data structures are treated as objects) and Functional (where code is treated as mathematical expressions) programming styles.

In recent years its use on server-side apps has increased dramatically, via frameworks like Node.js and game development.

## Syntax

### Semicolons

In JavaScript, semicolons are used to separate statements, and are placed at the end of a line. Some common statements are variable declarations, assignments, and function calls. While semicolons are often not required, it is generally safer (and more efficient for the computer to parse) when they are included. They are _not needed_ after **if statements**, **for and while loops**, or **function definitions**.

### Variables

A variable is a symbolic name that can be used to store a value. As the term _variable_ suggests, this value can be changed. In JavaScript, when declaring a variable for the first time, its name is preceded by the word "var":
	
    var _name = "Tom";
    
If we wanted to update the value in this variable later on, "var" is no longer needed since the variable has already been declared into the **Namespace** (more on those later):

	_name = "Amy";

### Dynamic Typing

Because JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, data types are inferred from values rather than declared in variables. What this means is that a variable "year" can be declared as a number:

	var _year = 2015;
    
and later updated as a string:

	var _year = "2015";
    
JavaScript interprets the _type_ of this variable from the value stored in it. In statically typed languages, the initial variable declaration would need to include a class type, and updating to a different class would throw a type error. Take Java, for instance:

	var _year = new Integer;
    
    _year = 2015;
    
This dynamic assignment that JavaScript allows for makes a developer's life much easier.

### Comments & Documentation

Writing well documented code is an early investment that continues to pay off over the course of development. It is often helpful to document your code **before writing it**. Writing pseudo-code or logic in comments before digging in will help to frame the problem more clearly and hopefully reduce time-consuming errors.

If code is thoroughly commented it is much easier to read and search through, whether it's you or another developer later on.

Comments in JavaScript can be written in two ways, single line or block notation:

	// this is a single line comment
    // these are useful for short comments, and placeholder pseudo-code
    
    /* This is a block comment.
    These are useful for lengthy explanations of complex
    functions that might spread mutliple lines */

## Data types

### String

Notice how the value we stored in the _name_ variable had quotes around it; those denote a data type called **String**. Strings can be wrapped in double or single quotes, the only governing rule being that they match (single with single, double with double). Let's declare a new string variable:

	var _year = "2015";

Because 2015 is wrapped in quotes, it is a string, not a **Number** — meaning mathematical operations cannot be performed on it. Strings can be added together or _concatenated_ by using the "+" operator:

	var _addedYear = "2" + "0" + "1" + "5";
    
Two strings are considered equal if they contain exactly the same characters, so:

	_year === _addedYear
    
would evaluate to _true_.

Give this is a try in the terminal!

### Number

Numbers in JavaScript are handled in a very straightforward fashion, as there is only one type. In many other languages, there is a distinction between _Integer_, _Float_, _Long_, _Double_, etc — all denoting different levels of accuracy (decimal points allowed). In JavaScript, you don't have to worry about any of that. 3 is equal to 3.0, and there will be no type errors thrown when trying to compare them.

Let's try setting some number variables and performing basic operations on them:

	var x = 10;
    var y = 0;
    
	// add them together and store in variable named "sum"
	var _sum = x + y;
    
    // substract them and store them in a variable named "diff"
    var _diff = x - y;
    
    // multiply them together and store them in a variable named "prod"
    var _prod = x * y;
    
    // divide them and store them in a variable named "quot"
    var _quot = x / y;

### Boolean

The two boolean values are _true_ and _false_. Booleans are very commonly used in conditional expressions, evaluating whether or not a condition is true before executing a function:

	var x = 5;
    if (x > 3) {
    	//do something
    }
    
Certain data types and expressions will always evaluate to either _true_ or _false_; the complete formula is outlined in the official JavaScript spec here:

[http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-9.2](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-9.2)


### Object

In JavaScript, everything besides the simple data types listed above is an **Object**. An object is a container of key/value pairs. A key (or name) is a string, and its corresponding value can be any data type other than _undefined_.

An **Object Literal** is the most common type of object, denoted as key/value pairs separated by colons, all within curly brackets:

	var _car = {
    	"model": "Corvette",
        "color": "red",
        "year": 2015
    }

There are two ways to access data from an object — **bracket notation** and **dot notation**:

	// bracket notation
	var _model = _car["model"];
    
    // dot notation
    var _model = _car.model;
    
    
### Arrays

An array is a simple indexed list of elements. Since it is technically treated as an object in JavaScript, you can think of it as an object whose keys are integers 0-n (n being the number of elements minus 1) as strings. Arrays are declared as comma-separated values within square brackets.

So, this array:

	var _yearArray = [2015, 2014, 2013];
    
is effectively the same as this object:

	var _yearObject = {
    	"0": 2015,
        "1": 2014,
        "2": 2013
    }
    
The main difference with an array is that there are many more methods available than with a standard object.

To access data in an array, you use bracket notation with the index of the element you would like to retrieve. To find the "ith" element of an array, you would do this:

	var _array = ["a", "b", "c"];
    _array[i];
    
where "i" is any integer value between 0 and n (n being length of array minus 1).

## Homework

Create an object that contains two truths and a lie about yourself. The key for each can just be an integer (0,1,2), and the value should be an array. The first element of the array should be a string containing the truth or lie, and the second element should be a boolean _true_ or _false_.

Next class we can share a few of these and practice retrieving data from an object to learn some interesting things about each other!
