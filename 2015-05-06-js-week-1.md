# A Brief Introduction to Computer Programming

## Let's set up our machines:

1. Install your text-editor ([Atom](atom.io) or [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)) — both are good options. Sublime is an industry favorite, and Atom is a newcomer developed by Github (and is open source!).
2. Download Google Chrome — ultimately you'll want to test your sites on all major browsers (Firefox, IE, Safari, Mobile Safari, etc), but for development we recommend Chrome so we're all using the same web inspector.
3. Create a Development folder in the home directory of your computer. On a Mac, you can navigate to your home directory by right-clicking the title at the top of a Finder window, and selecting your username. On a PC, your home directory equivalent is the C drive. This is the folder where you can keep all your various web development projects, rather than cluttering up your desktop or documents.
4. Sign up for [Slack](slack.com) in the group set up by your instructor. Slack is an excellent tool for group communication, and can be used in RampUp for general announcements, questions, and discussion.
5. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (for mac), and run "brew install rhino" to set up [Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino). Rhino is a command-line interface for JavaScript which will allow us to write basic functions in the terminal.

Programming languages..

## Where JavaScript fits in

JavaScript is an interpreted language designed primarily for client-side use on the web.

## Syntax

## Variables

## Data types

## Documentation

Writing well documented code is an early investment that continues to pay off over the course of development. It is often helpful to document your code **before writing it**. Writing pseudo-code or logic in comments before digging in will help to frame the problem more clearly and hopefully reduce time-consuming errors.

If code is thoroughly commented it is much easier to read and search through, whether it's you or another developer later on.
