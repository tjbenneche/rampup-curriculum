# Let's Talk About jQuery

jQuery is a free, open-source JavaScript library designed to make DOM manipulation easier.

## Including the jQuery Library

Because jQuery is just a library of JavaScript code, we have to include it in our HTML in order for our custom JS to utilize it.

To do so, we use a script tag just like we would our own JS files:

	<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>

You'll notice the url provided on jQuery's site (or any other CDN: Google, Microsoft, etc) does not include "http" or "https", and instead just begins with "//". This is called a "protocol relative URL", meaning it will load whether a user is acessing via http or https.

We must take care to include this script tag BEFORE any custom JS that makes use of the jQuery library, because of the order in which browsers parse HTML:

	<html>
    	<head>
        </head>
        <body>
        ...
        <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>
        <script src="main.js"></script>
        </body>
    </html>
    

        

## Converting Pure JS to jQuery

Let's start 

$('');
id, class, element, attribute, multiples

.toggle

.toggleClass() add, remove
.css

.text
.empty

## this and $(this)

this is raw JS, $(this) is jQuery

## Syntactic Sugar

.preventDefault()

$.each() - for loops

.prev, .next

.attr()

.animate

.find - better performance than simple jQuery selector which uses Sizzle engine (amazing code, but avoid if possible).


.slideToggle

.html

.append, .after, .before

## Chaining

don't query the DOM as much

## Waiting for DOM to load

$(document).ready(function(){

});
