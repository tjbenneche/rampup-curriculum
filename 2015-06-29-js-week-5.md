# Let's Talk About jQuery

jQuery is a free, open-source JavaScript library designed to make DOM manipulation easier.

A note from the jQuery website:
"One important thing to know is that jQuery is just a JavaScript library. All the power of jQuery is accessed via JavaScript, so having a strong grasp of JavaScript is essential for understanding, structuring, and debugging your code. While working with jQuery regularly can, over time, improve your proficiency with JavaScript, it can be hard to get started writing jQuery without a working knowledge of JavaScript's built-in constructs and syntax."

## Including the jQuery Library

Because jQuery is just a library of JavaScript code, we have to include it in our HTML in order for our custom JS to utilize it.

To do so, we use a script tag just like we would our own JS files:

	<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>

You'll notice the url provided on jQuery's site (or any other CDN: Google, Microsoft, etc) does not include "http" or "https", and instead just begins with "//". This is called a "protocol relative URL", meaning it will load whether a user is acessing via http or https.

We must take care to include this script tag BEFORE any custom JS that makes use of the jQuery library, because of the order in which browsers parse HTML:

	<html>
    	<head>
        </head>
        <body>
        ...
        <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>
        <script src="main.js"></script>
        </body>
    </html>
    

## Selectors

Selecting Elements by ID
1
$( "#myId" ); // Note IDs must be unique per page.
link Selecting Elements by Class Name
1
$( ".myClass" );
link Selecting Elements by Attribute
1
$( "input[name='first_name']" ); // Beware, this can be very slow in older browsers
link Selecting Elements by Compound CSS Selector
1
$( "#contents ul.people li" );
link Pseudo-Selectors

$( "a.external:first" );
$( "tr:odd" );
 
// Select all input-like elements in a form (more on this below).
$( "#myForm :input" );
$( "div:visible" );
 
// All except the first three divs.
$( "div:gt(2)" );
 
// All currently animated divs.
$( "div:animated" );

is that element there? if element.length

## Converting Pure JS to jQuery

Let's start 

$('');
id, class, element, attribute, multiples

.toggle

.toggleClass() add, remove
.css

.text
.empty

## this and $(this)

this is raw JS, $(this) is jQuery

## Syntactic Sugar

.preventDefault()

$.each() - for loops
.attr()

-set .attr('value', 'tom');
-get


.animate

.find - better performance than simple jQuery selector which uses Sizzle engine (amazing code, but avoid if possible).


.slideToggle

.html

.append, .after, .before

## Parents and Children

traversing

// Selecting an element's direct parent:
 
// returns [ div.child ]
$( "span.subchild" ).parent();
 
// Selecting all the parents of an element that match a given selector:
 
// returns [ div.parent ]
$( "span.subchild" ).parents( "div.parent" );
 
// returns [ div.child, div.parent, div.grandparent ]
$( "span.subchild" ).parents();
 
// Selecting all the parents of an element up to, but *not including* the selector:
 
// returns [ div.child, div.parent ]
$( "span.subchild" ).parentsUntil( "div.grandparent" );
 
// Selecting the closest parent, note that only one parent will be selected
// and that the initial element itself is included in the search:
 
// returns [ div.child ]
$( "span.subchild" ).closest( "div" );
 
// returns [ div.child ] as the selector is also included in the search:
$( "div.child" ).closest( "div" );

children:

// Selecting an element's direct children:
 
// returns [ div.parent, div.surrogateParent1, div.surrogateParent2 ]
$( "div.grandparent" ).children( "div" );
 
// Finding all elements within a selection that match the selector:
 
// returns [ div.child, div.parent, div.surrogateParent1, div.surrogateParent2 ]
$( "div.grandparent" ).find( "div" );

siblings:

next, prev, siblings


## Chaining

don't query the DOM as much

## Waiting for DOM to load

This function is slightly better than the original JavaScript one, as it will run as soon as the DOM is ready to manipulated, rather than waiting for all images to load.
$(document).ready(function(){

});

window.onload = function() {
 
    alert( "welcome" );
 
};
