# Let's Talk About jQuery

jQuery is a free, open-source JavaScript library designed to make DOM manipulation easier.

A note from the jQuery website:
"One important thing to know is that jQuery is just a JavaScript library. All the power of jQuery is accessed via JavaScript, so having a strong grasp of JavaScript is essential for understanding, structuring, and debugging your code. While working with jQuery regularly can, over time, improve your proficiency with JavaScript, it can be hard to get started writing jQuery without a working knowledge of JavaScript's built-in constructs and syntax."

## Including the jQuery Library

Because jQuery is an external library, we have to include it in our HTML in order for our custom JS to utilize it.

To do so, we use a script tag just like we would our own JS files:

	<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>

You'll notice the url provided on jQuery's site (or any other CDN: Google, Microsoft, etc) does not include "http" or "https", and instead just begins with "//". This is called a "protocol relative URL", meaning it will load whether a user is acessing via http or https.

We must take care to include this script tag BEFORE any custom JS that makes use of the jQuery library, because of the order in which browsers parse HTML:

	<html>
    	<head>
        </head>
        <body>
        ...
        <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>
        <script src="main.js"></script>
        </body>
    </html>
    

## Selectors

The first thing we'll want to do to begin accessing the power of jQuery is learn how to select elements. 

In JavaScript, the functions we used were getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and getElementsByTagName. These are quite tedious to type out and come with their own host of inconveniences (like having to separate out elements from the arrays returned by ClassName and TagName).

jQuery selectors are much simpler to use, and look almost identical to CSS selectors, just wrapped in jQuery's "object notation". An object wrapper in jQuery begins with a dollar sign and contains its selector within parentheses and quotes, like so:

	$("selector")
    
Just like in CSS, we can select an element via its **tag name**, which returns any matching elements on the page:

	$("div")
    
or **class** with CSS's dot notation:

	$(".class-name")
    
or **id** with CSS's pound notation:

	$("#id-name")

or **attribute** with CSS's attribute notation (though do this with caution, as it is a very costly operation):

	$("input[value="one"]")

or **selector combinations**:

	$("nav ul.menu li#home")

or **pseudo-selectors:

	$("img:visible")

is that element there? if element.length

## Converting Pure JS to jQuery

Let's take a look at what some of the code we wrote last week looks like in jQuery.

### Working With Classes

Our JavaScript code:

	function addClass(selector, newClass){
    	if (type == "class"){
        	var elems = document.getElementsByClassName('selector');
            for(var i = 0; i < elems.length; i++){
            	elems[i].className = elem.className + " " + newClass;
            }
        }
        else if(type == "tag"){
        	var elems = document.getElementsByTagName('selector');
            for(var i = 0; i < elems.length; i++){
            	elems[i].className = elem.className + " " + newClass;
            }
        }
        else{
        	var elem = document.getElementById('selector');
        	elem.className = elem.className + " " + newClass;
        }
    }


.toggleClass() add, remove

### Hide and Show

Our JavaScript code:

	function hide(selector, type){
    	if (type == "class"){
    		document.getElementsByClassName(selector).style.display = "none";
        }
        else if(type == "tag"){
        	document.getElementsByTagName(selector).style.display = "none";
        }
        else{
        	document.getElementById(selector).style.display = "none";
        }
    }
    
    function hide(selector, type){
    	if (type == "class"){
    		document.getElementsByClassName(selector).style.display = "block";
        }
        else if(type == "tag"){
        	document.getElementsByTagName(selector).style.display = "block";
        }
        else{
        	document.getElementById(selector).style.display = "block";
        }
    }

in jQuery:

	$('element').hide();
    
    $('element').show();
    
    $('element').toggle();
    
.css
It's not recommended to use .css() as a setter in production-ready code, but when passing in an object to set CSS, CSS properties will be camelCased instead of using a hyphen.
As a getter, the .css() method is valuable. However, it should generally be avoided as a setter in production-ready code, because it's generally best to keep presentational information out of JavaScript code. Instead, write CSS rules for classes that describe the various visual states, and then change the class on the element.

.text
.empty

## this and $(this)

this is raw JS, $(this) is jQuery

## Syntactic Sugar

.preventDefault()

$.each() - for loops
.attr()

-set .attr('value', 'tom');
-get


.animate

.find - better performance than simple jQuery selector which uses Sizzle engine (amazing code, but avoid if possible).


.slideToggle

.html

.append, .after, .before

## Parents and Children

traversing

// Selecting an element's direct parent:
 
// returns [ div.child ]
$( "span.subchild" ).parent();
 
// Selecting all the parents of an element that match a given selector:
 
// returns [ div.parent ]
$( "span.subchild" ).parents( "div.parent" );
 
// returns [ div.child, div.parent, div.grandparent ]
$( "span.subchild" ).parents();
 
// Selecting all the parents of an element up to, but *not including* the selector:
 
// returns [ div.child, div.parent ]
$( "span.subchild" ).parentsUntil( "div.grandparent" );
 
// Selecting the closest parent, note that only one parent will be selected
// and that the initial element itself is included in the search:
 
// returns [ div.child ]
$( "span.subchild" ).closest( "div" );
 
// returns [ div.child ] as the selector is also included in the search:
$( "div.child" ).closest( "div" );

children:

// Selecting an element's direct children:
 
// returns [ div.parent, div.surrogateParent1, div.surrogateParent2 ]
$( "div.grandparent" ).children( "div" );
 
// Finding all elements within a selection that match the selector:
 
// returns [ div.child, div.parent, div.surrogateParent1, div.surrogateParent2 ]
$( "div.grandparent" ).find( "div" );

siblings:

next, prev, siblings


## Chaining

don't query the DOM as much
