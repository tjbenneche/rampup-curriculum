# RampUp: Week 1: A Brief Introduction to The Web

## Class workflow overview
1. Set up development enviroment on students' computers
2. Discuss some history and fundamentals of the web and the technologies we use to build content on it
3. Examine a typical file tree setup
4. Discuss the different syntaxes and document structures of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
5. Dissect a live site, wireframe it out, and discuss the elements potentially used
6. Using the web inspector, examine the actual code
5. Build a basic HTML page together, link it to a CSS document




## Let's set up our machines:
1. Install your text-editor ([Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/)) — both are good options. Sublime is an industry favorite, and Atom is a newcomer developed by Github (and is open source!).
2. Download [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) — ultimately you'll want to test your sites on all major browsers (Firefox, IE, Safari, Mobile Safari, etc), but for development we recommend Chrome so we're all using the same web inspector.
3. Create a Development folder in the home directory of your computer. On a Mac, you can navigate to your home directory by right-clicking the title at the top of a Finder window, and selecting your username. On a PC, your home directory equivalent is the C drive. This is the folder where you can keep all your various web development projects, rather than cluttering up your desktop or documents.
4. Sign up for [Slack](https://slack.com/) in the group set up by your instructor. Slack is an excellent tool for group communication, and can be used in RampUp for general announcements, questions, and discussion.

## A little context:

### How does a website actually work?

![](/img/overview.png)

Above is a basic diagram of what's happening behind the scenes of a live website. The process is typically some variation of this:
- The URL (or domain name) you type into a browser is mapped to an IP address, which uniquely identifies a web server (either a virtualized computer or a physical machine). Of the web hosting services depicted above, Github Pages (free) and Amazon S3 (very cheap) are static — meaning they are ideal for simple websites with little dynamic content (e.g. a small personal site, a splash page for a product, etc). If you are building a site with more dynamic content (e.g. a CMS like Wordpress, a web application, etc) you would likely need to rent a web server through a service like Amazon EC2 or Rackspace (which get quite expensive over time).
- When the browser pings your web server, it receives the specified index document (typically index.html), interprets it, and renders the page as you see it. Web browsers — like their human creators — read documents top to bottom. As such, it is best practice to place links to CSS documents at the very top of an HTML doc (in the head), so that as elements get laid out on the page they already exhibit their respective styles and positioning. Links to JavaScript documents tend to go at the bottom of an HTML doc to reduce page load time, as they require the most work from the browser.

### Content, Presentation, and Behavior

There are three primary types of documents that go into the making of a static website: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the early days of the web, before the introduction of CSS, styles were written inline in HTML tags, like so:

	<p style="background:#ccc; color:#fff; border: solid black 1px;">
    
Or, specific tags were used for no purpose other than an aesthetic change, like so:

	<p>The is sentence has a word that is <em>bold</em></p>
    
There are a number of reasons why the web moved away from this and toward the separation of content from layout, but the primary two are machine readability and human understanding. Human understanding here means a person's ability to recognize a problem and efficiently arrive at a solution. If styles are mixed in with content, it quickly gets difficult to discern which of the two is causing a given problem. By separating content from presentation, we make the debugging process much more efficient. The second reason — machine readability — refers to a computer's ability to detect meaning. Any HTML tag should be semantic, meaning its function is a logical consequence of its name. The "em" tag, as shown above, is not semantic. Its name implies emphasis, but its function could be anything from the title of the entire page to a single bolded word in an inconsequential paragraph. When code is not semantic, computers have difficulty discerning meaning — and thus your site will perform worse in SEO rankings, which are determined largely by bots (computers) crawling the web.

### HTML

HTML (hypertext markup language) contains the structure and content of a web page. An HTML document is broken up into two parts: the head and the body. Imagine these two as sections of a house:

![](/img/house.png)

The head is the attic: while there are important things stored away up there, no its contents are invisible to visitors of the house. Everything within the body tags, however, is the visible content of the web page — the elements seen by visitors. The head may contain links to CSS documents, meta tags, the page title, etc — whereas the body contains visible elements like images, headinigs, paragraphs, hyperlinks, videos, and so on.

### CSS

CSS (cascading style sheets) contains the style rules defined for a page. Within CSS rules you can specify rules for HTML elements by using selectors. Selectors may be tag names (p, a, div, etc.), classes, or IDs (more on those later). After specifying which selector to target, you define various style rules (color, size, position, etc) within curly braces.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language primarily used to manipulate content on a web page (trigger an event when a user clicks a button, iterate through an image carousel, send data from an HTML form to a web server, etc.), though recently it has also become fairly common to see it used as a server-side language (say, to create a web app using Node.js). We will not delve much into JavaScript in this class, though if there is time we will experiment with triggering simple events on click of a button, or things to that effect.



### File Hierarchy

    .
    ├── index.html
    ├── css
    |   ├── style.css
    ├── img
    |   ├── banner.jpg
    |   └── logo.svg
    |	└── graphic.png
    ├── js
    |   ├── main.js
    |   └── slider.js

### Document Structure
    
HTML:    

      <!DOCTYPE html>
      <html>
          <head>
              <title>My Website</title>
              <meta charset="utf-8">
              <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
          </head>
          <body>
              <h1>Hello World</h1>
              <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
              <script type="text/javascript" src="js/main.js"></script>
          </body>
      </html>

CSS:

		body{
        	background-color: blue;
            font-size: 10px;
        }
        p,a{
        	font-size: 1.6rem;
        }
        h1{
        	font-size: 2.2rem;
            font-weight: 600;
        }

JS:

		$('.button').on('click', function(){
        	alert('Hello world!');
        });
        
        
## Dissecting a live website

Choose a site, (e.g. [NYTimes](http://www.nytimes.com/), [Startup Institute](https://www.startupinstitute.com/), [Warby Parker](https://www.warbyparker.com/), and put it up on the projector (which is hopefully facing a whiteboard). Trace out the site's skeleton on top of its projection and try to logically group elements when doing so. What you should be left with at the end is a basic wireframe of the site. From this, discuss the various grouping elements potentially used (div, section, article, aside, etc.) and what elements were likely used within them.

What we can do next is right click on the page, and select "Inspect Element". This will open up the developer tools (called the web inspector in Chrome), which is a very powerful set of tools for examining code (and debugging if it's yours), quickly testing changes, and a whole host of other things.

There are several tabs in here that each serve a different function, but for now we'll focus on the first one — Elements. This displays the site's HTML as rendered by the browser (in contrast with the HTML you'll see if you select "View Page Source" after right clicking, which is the raw code as it was originally written). You can click through to see what each element is, how it is grouped, etc. And on the right hand side you'll see the styles — any CSS rules affecting the element currently selected. Here you can uncheck boxes to remove certain rules, and even type your own to quickly test ideas! The inspector will become your best friend as you're building sites, and once you begin using JavaScript, the Console tab will become much more useful to you.

## Homework/Lab

Next week we will begin work on a project that will last the duration of the course. In the meantime, continue experimenting with your site by adding HTML tags and styling them in CSS.

There are also some great exercises available for free over at [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) you can check out.
