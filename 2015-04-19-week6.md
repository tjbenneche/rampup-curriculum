# Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design can be broken down into two components: a design philosophy, and CSS style rules that accommodate multiple browser sizes.


## Graceful Degradataion vs Progressive Enhancement

This is the story of two design philosophies: one which dominated the old web, and one tailored for the new where mobile phones prevail. **Graceful degradation** is designing an optimal experience for the largest, most feature-rich browser (typically a large, modern desktop browser) first, and stripping away as browser size and capability decreases. **Progressive enhancement** is optimizing for the smallest, most restrictive browser (typically a mobile phone, perhaps a slightly outdated version) first, and embellishing as browser size and capability increases.

On the surface, each of these methods would seemingly produce similar results — so why do we even? Since few designers like to spend their time or energy on less-than-ideal designs, there is a tendency to put the most time and effort into your optimal design. So with a graceful degradation approach, you often end up with a watered down version of our optimal design after stripping away features and content. With progressive enhancement, you focus on creating an ideal experience for mobile, deciding to include only features that are necessary. Then as you expand out, anything you add in is just icing on an already optimal cake.

And if the holistic "things tend to be better" argument isn't enough for you, progressive enhancement can lead to more performant sites as well. If you are going to hide certain assets like video or images in your mobile design, it might make sense to only load them in at larger screen sizes. This is because even when you hide something using _display: none;_ in CSS, the browser still needs to make a request to load that asset. The more requests the browser has to make, the slower your page loads.

## Media Queries

A media query is an expression that specifies a range in which the styles it contains will be applied. We can now start to think of our CSS documents as being separated into zones defined
