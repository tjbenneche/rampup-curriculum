# Responsive Web Design

Responsive web design can be broken down into two components: a design philosophy, and CSS style rules that accommodate multiple browser sizes.


## Graceful Degradataion vs Progressive Enhancement

This is the story of two design philosophies: one which dominated the old web, and one tailored for the new where mobile phones prevail. **Graceful degradation** is designing an optimal experience for the largest, most feature-rich browser (typically a large, modern desktop browser) first, and stripping away as browser size and capability decreases. **Progressive enhancement** is optimizing for the smallest, most restrictive browser (typically a mobile phone, perhaps a slightly outdated version) first, and embellishing as browser size and capability increases.

So why do we even?
