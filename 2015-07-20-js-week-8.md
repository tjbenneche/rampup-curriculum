# Hackathon

This is the last week of RampUp, and we will be doing something very fun! We're going to take all the knowledge we've accumulated over the past seven weeks and create something awesome.

## Setup

To do this, we'll first break into groups (ideally two, three depending on class size). Groups should try to maintain a relatively even split of skill level.

Each group will be working on the same task, though will likely end up with quite different code (via different approaches to the problem, varying coding styles, etc). After an hour and a half is up, we will stop and present the results. Think of the instructor as a designated hitter for both teams, who will be bouncing back and forth to provide help as needed with the goal of each team producing a functional project.

## Task

Create a one-page, to scale replica of the solar system. CSS and HTML framework will be provided here: [http://codepen.io/tjbenneche/pen/dojrgd](http://codepen.io/tjbenneche/pen/dojrgd).

### Steps

1. Use AJAX to pull data on each of the planets from the provided [JSON](http://idahoptv.org/ntti/nttilessons/lessons2000/lau1.html) file and store in corresponding variables. This will require JavaScipt loops and conditionals.
2. Use jQuery to insert elements onto the page for each planet.
3. Use jQuery to add appropriate classes and ids to each planet that match the stylesheet provided. This will give the planets color, rotation, etc.

## Present

After 1.5 hrs have passed, it is time for each group to present!
