# The CSS Box Model & Positioning: A Complex Love Story

## The Box Model

**Every** visible HTML element — be it text, a container, an image, etc — is rendered by the browser as a rectangle. An old technique for visualizing this when building the layout of a page was adding a CSS background-color or border to each element, and now there is a wonderful Chrome and Safari extension that does just that called [Pesticide](http://pesticide.io/).

So much time and thought has gone into visualizing elements' boxiness because it is fundamental to understanding and constructing the layout of a webpage. Back in its CSS 1 recommendation, the w3 introduced a formatting guide called the [Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box_model). This model explains how _width_, _height_, _padding_, _border_ and _margin_ get applied to an element.

<div style="width:300px; height:200px; border:1px dashed black; background-color:orange;">
	
    <p style="text-align:center;">margin</p>
	<div style="width:250px; height:150px; border:1px solid black; background-color:green; margin:-10px auto 0;">
    
    	<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">padding</p>
        <div style="width:200px; height:100px; background-color:white; margin:-10px auto 0;">
        	
            <p style="text-align:center;">element</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

As we mentioned last week, the properties for setting the width and height of an element are _width_ and _height_, respectively. However, to take a more technical look at things, what we are really setting is the width of the content box. You can think of an element as being contained in three boxes: content box, padding box, and margin box — with border falling between margin and padding.

So, if we have the following CSS applied to a div:

	div{
      width:300px;
      padding:20px;
      margin-left:30px;
    }

the width of the content box (just the element itself) is 300px, but the full calculated width (as rendered by the browser) can be calculated like so:

_margin-left + border-left + padding-left + content width + padding-right + border-right + margin-right_

which, in this case would be: 30px + 20px + 300px + 20px = 370px
