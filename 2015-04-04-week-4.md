## The Box Model

**Every** visible HTML element — be it text, a container, an image, etc — is rendered by the browser as a rectangle. An old technique for visualizing this when building the layout of a page was adding a CSS background-color or border to each element, and now there is a wonderful Chrome and Safari extension that does just that called [Pesticide](http://pesticide.io/).

So much time and thought has gone into visualizing elements' boxiness because it is fundamental to understanding and constructing the layout of a webpage. Back in its CSS 1 recommendation, the w3 introduced a formatting guide called the [Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box_model). This model explains how _width_, _height_, _padding_, _border_ and _margin_ get applied to an element.

<div style="width:300px; height:200px; border:1px dashed black; background-color:orange;">
	
    <p style="text-align:center;">margin</p>
	<div style="width:250px; height:150px; border:1px solid black; background-color:green; margin:-10px auto 0;">
    
    	<p style="color:white; text-align:center;">padding</p>
        <div style="width:200px; height:100px; background-color:white; margin:-10px auto 0;">
        	
            <p style="text-align:center;">element</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>


As we mentioned last week, the properties for setting the width and height of an element are _width_ and _height_, respectively. However, to take a more technical look at things, what we are really setting is the width of the content box. You can think of an element as being contained in three boxes: content box, padding box, and margin box — with border falling between margin and padding.

So, if we have the following CSS applied to a div:

	div{
      width:300px;
      padding:20px;
      margin-left:30px;
    }

the width of the content box (just the element itself) is 300px, but the full calculated width (as rendered by the browser) can be calculated like so:

_margin-left + border-left + padding-left + content width + padding-right + border-right + margin-right_

which, in this case would evaluate to: 30px + 20px + 300px + 20px = 370px

In the near future, browsers will likely adopt support of a new CSS property called [box-sizing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-sizing), which should simplifiy this a bit by allowing you to tell the browser to include more of these layers in the standard _width_ property.

## Document Flow

This term will come up quite a bit over the next couple weeks, so let's get a working definition out of the way: the _normal document flow_ is the default way elements get laid out on a webpage. Generally speaking, elements are laid out from top to bottom in the order in which they appear in the code, and do their best not to overlap each other. When an element is taken _out of the normal flow_, it may ignore its sibling elements (in the case of _float_ and _position: absolute_, or even ignore its parent elements all the way up to the _body_ tag (in the case of _position: fixed_).

## Position

### position: static

By default, all HTML elements are set to _position: static_. A statically positioned element behaves as expected in the normal flow of the document, much like a relatively positioned element. Where it differs is that it does not respond to _top_, _right_, _bottom_ or _left_ properties.

### position: relative

A relatively positioned element is by most accounts indistinguishable from a statically postioned one, in that it remains in the normal document flow. Some key differences include responding to _top_, _right_, _bottom_ or _left_ properties, and allowing a child element to be absolutely positioned within it.

### position: absolute

An absolutely positioned element is taken out of the normal flow of the document, meaning it is ignored when placing sibling elements on the page. It can be placed anywhere within the bounding box of its parent element, using the  _top_, _right_, _bottom_ or _left_ properties. 


### position: fixed

An element with fixed position is also taken out of the normal document flow, however what differentiates it from an absolutely positioned element is that its bounding box is the viewport (entire visible browser window), and it does not respond to scroll. This is typically used for "sticky headers", nav bars that stick to the top of the page as you scroll.

Another variant which for now still has limited browser support is _position: sticky_. This allows an element to be treated as relatively positioned up until a specified scroll position, at which point it becomes fixed. A good usecase for this would be the header scroll behavior on Startup Institute's current [site](https://www.startupinstitute.com/).

## Display

The _display_ property dictates how an element's containing box behaves. There are four primary values used: _inline_, _inline-block_, _block_, and _none_. 

### inline

An inline element, as its name suggests, sits _in line_ with other elements. Some common elements that are inline by default are "span", "em" and "strong" — each of which are used to put emphasis or different styling on a word or section of text, without pulling it out of the normal flow. They take up only as much space as their contents dictate. Inline elements don't come without their share of headaches, though — as they do not respond to width or height, nor margin/padding on the top or bottom.

### block

It makes sense to talk about block next, as inline-block is essentially a hybrid of inline and block. Block-level elements have no restrictions on the properties that can be set, and by default take up as much width as possible (and thus, do not allow other elements to sit in a line with them).

### inline-block

Inline-block elements have all the benefits of block, but — like inline elements — allow others to sit next to them horizontally and only take up as much space as their contents. There is, however, a bizarre caveat to using inline-block: if you were to make two inline-block elements exactly 50% width, they would not sit next to each other on a line. This is because browsers add a 4px side margin by default to inline-block elements. While this is frustrating, there are [many workarounds](https://css-tricks.com/fighting-the-space-between-inline-block-elements/), and other ways to get elements to sit on a line margin-free.

## Float

Float is one of those ways, though it comes with its own handful of difficulties as well.
