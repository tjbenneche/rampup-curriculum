# The CSS Box Model & Positioning: A Complex Love Story

## The Box Model

**Every** visible HTML element — be it text, a container, an image, etc — is rendered by the browser as a rectangle. An old technique for visualizing this when building the layout of a page was adding a CSS background-color or border to each element, and now there is a wonderful Chrome and Safari extension that does just that called [Pesticide](http://pesticide.io/).

So much time and thought has gone into visualizing elements' boxiness because it is fundamental to understanding and constructing the layout of a webpage. Back in its CSS 1 recommendation, the w3 introduced a formatting guide called the [Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box_model). This model explains how width, height, padding, border and margin get applied to an element.

<div style="width:300px; border:1px dashed black; background-color:orange;">
	
    <p>margin</p>
	<div style="width:80%; border:1px solid black; background-color:green; margin:auto;">
    
    	<p>padding</p>
        <div style="width:80%; background-color:white; margin:auto;">
        	
            <p>element</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
