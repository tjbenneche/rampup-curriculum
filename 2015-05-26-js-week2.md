## Switch Statements

A switch statement evaluates an expression compared to a defined set of _cases_. If it finds a match, the statements associated with that _case_ will be executed. The _break_ after each tells the program to kick out of the switch statement after the code for a matching case has been executed. If the _break_ is omitted, the program will execute statements for all the following cases as well, regardless of whether or not they match.

Let's try writing one for days of the week, alerting a different message for each day:

	var _day = "Tuesday";
    switch (_day) {
    	case "Monday":
        	return "Today is Monday";
            break;
        case "Tuesday":
        	return "Today is Tuesday";
            break;
        case "Wednesday":
        	return "Today is Wednesday";
            break;
        case "Thursday":
        	return "Today is Thursday";
            break;
        case "Friday":
        	return "Today is Friday";
            break;
        case "Saturday":
        	return "Today is Saturday";
            break;
        case "Sunday":
        	return "Today is Sunday";
            break;
        default:
        	return "That is not a day of the week";
    }
