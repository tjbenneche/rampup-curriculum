# Statements & Loops

## Review

Declare variable

Concat string

Math operations

Make object and retrieve data from it

## Class Workflow

1. if, else, else if
2. switch
3. for
4. while

## If Statements

explanation, tie into booleans

if/else

### else if

## Switch Statements

A switch statement evaluates an expression compared to a defined set of _cases_. If it finds a match, the statements associated with that _case_ will be executed. The _break_ after each tells the program to kick out of the switch statement after the code for a matching case has been executed. If the _break_ is omitted, the program will execute statements for all the following cases as well, regardless of whether or not they match.

Let's try writing one for days of the week, alerting a different message 

	var _day = "Tuesday";
    switch (_day) {
    	case "Monday":
        	alert("Today is Monday");
            break;
        case "Tuesday":
        	alert("Today is Tuesday");
            break;
        case "Wednesday":
        	alert("Today is Wednesday");
            break;
        case "Thursday":
        	alert("Today is Thursday");
            break;
        case "Friday":
        	alert("Today is Friday");
            break;
        case "Saturday":
        	alert("Today is Saturday");
            break;
        case "Sunday":
        	alert("Today is Sunday");
            break;
        default:
        	alert("That is not a day of the week");
    }

## Homework
poker hand
  
Create an **object** that contains three poker hands: a _Full House_, a _Royal Flush_, and _4 of a Kind_. The key should be the name of the hand, and the value an array of the five cards (using strings, i.e. "King of Clubs", "Two of Diamonds", etct).
  
Create a variable called "hand" and use a **switch statement** to evaluate the hand and alert some information accordingly.

In each case, use a **for loop** to create a string that reads "This hand is a _Hand Name_ and contains a _Card 1_, _Card 2_, _Card 3_, _Card 4_, _Card 5_".
