# Statements & Loops

## Review

Students volunteer to do the following either on the whiteboard or projector, depending on complexity:

1. Declare a variable and then update its value.
2. Declare a string variable, then add to it by concatenating another string.
3. Create two number variables and multiply them together, storing the result in a sum variable.
4. Create a simple object and retrieve some data from it, either via bracket or dot notation.

## Class Workflow

Explanation of context, importance, reasoning for order

1. if, else, else if
2. switch
3. for
4. while

## If Statements

explanation, tie into booleans

if/else

### else if

## Switch Statements

A switch statement evaluates an expression compared to a defined set of _cases_. If it finds a match, the statements associated with that _case_ will be executed. The _break_ after each tells the program to kick out of the switch statement after the code for a matching case has been executed. If the _break_ is omitted, the program will execute statements for all the following cases as well, regardless of whether or not they match.

Let's try writing one for days of the week, alerting a different message 

	var _day = "Tuesday";
    switch (_day) {
    	case "Monday":
        	alert("Today is Monday");
            break;
        case "Tuesday":
        	alert("Today is Tuesday");
            break;
        case "Wednesday":
        	alert("Today is Wednesday");
            break;
        case "Thursday":
        	alert("Today is Thursday");
            break;
        case "Friday":
        	alert("Today is Friday");
            break;
        case "Saturday":
        	alert("Today is Saturday");
            break;
        case "Sunday":
        	alert("Today is Sunday");
            break;
        default:
        	alert("That is not a day of the week");
    }

## While Loops

A while loop continuously executes statements until the condition it's evaluating is no longer true. There must be some increment specified within the statement, otherwise you will have an infinite loop and your program will crash. 

	var _countdown = 10;
    var i = 0;
	while (_countdown > i) {
    	alert('Time left: ' + _countdown);
        _countdown -= 1;
    }

## For Loops

A for loop is effectively a special kind of while loop. The key differences are semantic:

1. A for loop can have a counter variable, condition to evaluate, and the increment in one line, which helps readability.
2. The counter variable can be declared _within_ the for loop, keeping it out of the global namespace.
3. While loops are technically indefinite at the time of compiling (though if written properly will at one point stop), whereas for loops have a finite number of iterations defined from the start.

Let's create a for loop that iterates through all the colors of the rainbow and outputs a message listing them:

	var _rainbow = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet'];
    var _message = "The colors of the rainbow are ";
    for (var i=0; i < _rainbow.length; i++) {
    	_message = _message + _rainbow[i];
    }

## Homework
poker hand
  
Create an **object** that contains three poker hands: a _Full House_, a _Royal Flush_, and _4 of a Kind_. The key should be the name of the hand, and the value an array of the five cards (using strings, i.e. "King of Clubs", "Two of Diamonds", etct).
  
Create a variable called "hand" and use a **switch statement** to evaluate the hand and alert some information accordingly.

In each case, use a **for loop** to create a string that reads "This hand is a _Hand Name_ and contains a _Card 1_, _Card 2_, _Card 3_, _Card 4_, _Card 5_".
